oovcde
======

Oovcde is a development environment for CLang based languages. The primary goals are:

    Allows analysis and development of high quality, object oriented code
    Ease of use
    Minimal dependencies

Current Features:

    Generates class, sequence and component diagrams from code automatically.
        The diagrams are based on UML, but are also a superset.
    Provides a build system that scans for project files and is very easy to set up.
    Provides a simple editor that uses CLang for syntax highlighting.
    Works with Linux or Windows
    Uses LLVM/CLang to parse C++ files
    Uses GTK as the window toolkit
