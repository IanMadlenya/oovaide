======

Oovcde is a development environment for CLang based languages. The primary goals and features are:

- Allows analysis and development of high quality, object oriented code
   * Generates class, sequence and component diagrams from code automatically.
   * Diagrams are based on UML, but are also a superset, and can be saved as .SVG.
- Ease of usability
   * Provides a build system that scans for project files, finds dependencies, and allows minimal set up.
   * Provides a simple editor that uses CLang for syntax highlighting and GDB for debugging.
   * Works with Linux or Windows
   * License is GPL Version 2
- Minimal dependencies
   * Uses LLVM/CLang to parse C++ files to find build dependencies and for analysis
   * Uses GNU tools such as AR and GDB
   * Uses GTK as the window toolkit
