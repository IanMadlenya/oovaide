## Features

- An analysis system that finds all source code and uses CLang to generate
  dependencies between files and components.
- The analysis system uses CLang to parse the object relationships and automatically
  generates diagrams as the programmer can navigate between the relationships.
  Diagrams can be edited in Oovcde, then saved as SVG and edited using tools such as Inkscape.
- A multithreaded build system that uses the analysis information for easy setup.
- A simple code editor with a debugger.
