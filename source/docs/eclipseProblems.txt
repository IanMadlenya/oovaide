
- Clutters up source directories with project files, intermediate
  and output directories.
- Project info changes when build config changes
  (Causes source management problem)
- Projects don't keep track of dependencies
	- Stale data, Clean, Refresh, Make Index/Rebuild
	- multiple configurations mess up dependencies
	- library change doesn't update executable
	- executables build with no changes
	- source shows syntax errors
- Order of compiling is not always the same (can be working on one
	problem, rebuild, and have to work on a different problem)
- Setting active configuration modifies project files
- Clean and Build are right next to each other on the menu
- Sometimes debugger doesn't stop, so build doesn't complete
- Pop up for editing while compiling is annoying.
- Multiple clicks for operations
- Some template errors display more than the console window can store
- Sometimes the link fails because the output is open even though
  Eclipse was the only thing previously running (Windows)
- If projects are building, output window updates for each project
  so finding errors is difficult until build completes.
- Right click, accidentally click "Close Project", means project must
  be deleted from workspace, and imported.
