
Features
--------
	See the web site for a list of features.

Explanations
------------
	- If operations aren't shown for classes, use -x c++ for Clang.
	- clean up compile warnings for %d/%ld and size_t
	- If float.h is or intrinics are missing, make sure clang dir is under exec dir (bin).
	- If classes aren't showing relation to std::vector<>, use "-x c++" for Clang.
	- Analysis will run again if there are include path errors
	  (changing switches or files will rerun)
	- If editor doesn't go to many defs, make sure include paths are correct
	  for analysis.

	- Non-class types are not shown (templated types)
	- graph doesn't display types through templates, typedefs (DiagramRect in DiagramGraph.h)
	- Show parameter reference/pointer/const in methods
	- find way to reduce strlen: std::allocator, std::less, std::basic_string<char> etc.
	  see ComponentBuilder
	- When class members are not shown, should be easy way to view members
	- Add go to operation (callbacks to journal)

- Cleanup
	- separate gui from backend - humble dialog
		- domain/presentation, business, backend, Business Logic Layer, Domain Logic
	- redesign:
		which drawer when:drawers are defined in view, all other class functions have
			explicit references (no set drawer)
		initialize does not draw in non-view classes
		draw / queue draw (remove all drawing from business, only for size)
		remove cairo initialization from initialize functions.
		remove/rename all updateGraph functions (reposition, etc.)
		safer to get pointer from journal instead of static pointer initialized when.
	- test:
		preferences
		switching drawer - svg

	- remove dup journal code
	- remove dup graph code
	- Remove duplicate connections for getRelatedBodyVarClasses, etc.

- Closed
	- BUG: Goto class doesn't change tab to class tab - journal requires this

- Future
	- Statistics / Quality measurement
		amount of const, number of raw pointers, minimal use of new/delete/malloc/...
		interface complexity, amount of encapsulation, size of exposed interface
			amount of state - even in called classes
		member functions called in any order?
		number of interface classes vs hidden classes in a module
		child classes that don't use parent class data/functions
		class - number of classes related to a class
		class - complexity of a class
		number of unused classes, methods, etc.
