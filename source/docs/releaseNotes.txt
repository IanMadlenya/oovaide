
Features
--------
	See the web site for a list of features.

Explanations
------------
	- If operations aren't shown for classes, use -x c++ for Clang.
	- If float.h is or intrinics are missing, make sure clang dir is under exec dir (bin).
	- If classes aren't showing relation to std::vector<>, use "-x c++" for Clang.
	- Analysis will run again if there are include path errors
	  (changing switches or files will rerun)
	- If editor doesn't go to many defs, make sure include paths are correct
	  for analysis.
