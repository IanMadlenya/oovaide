
Features
--------
	See the web site for a list of features.

Explanations
------------
	- If operations aren't shown for classes, use -x c++ for Clang.
	- If classes aren't showing relation to std::vector<>, use "-x c++" for Clang.
	- Analysis will run again if there are include path errors
	  (changing switches or files will rerun)


Missing Features
----------------
- General
	- Only 64 bit linux build is provided.
	- Should release with mingw-builds headers
	- fix sleepMs
- Docs
	- __builtin_ia32_bsrsi, mmintrin.h are GNU files, and clang is not
	  compatible. Compile with g++ instead? Ubuntu problem?
- Gui
	- BUG: Sometimes oovcde.txt settings other config copied to analysis
	- BUG: First component in list doesn't save type in Build/Settings
	- BUG: Sometimes the Add Package dialog doesn't hide/close.
		- window might be busy and is not responding (oovCommon/PackagesProcess?)
	- Allow directory tree to be a single component.
	- Clicking on warnings doesn't display editor. Also change to double click?
	- Doesn't load new include paths when reopening a project. (Close oovcde and restart)
	- Changing preferences should update drawings
	- Refactor to improve separation of GUI. Collection of graphs in backend.
		http://geekswithblogs.net/gregorymalcolm/archive/2009/07/14/user-interface-patterns.aspx
	- Refactoring functions
		- Display unused public functions of a class
		- Dump ASCII public functions
- Source/project management
	- Make it clear which files must be saved to save project settings.
	  Gui Options don't get recreated if project is opened instead of newed.
	- Add more multitasking: library symbols, loading projects
- Building
	- The oovcde-incdeps file should be regenerated if the build settings change
	- Multithreaded build output is not synchronized well enough
	- Should have a version error when the analysis dir has version problems
	- A static lib without source should not be on link lines
	- TEST const calls/oper overloading
	- Fast loading XMI, parse func defs later (first store statement string)
	- Should include mingw-builds includes so that threading errors don't occur
	- oovcde-incdeps once got corrupted during debugging and slowed down and
	  prevented parsing.
	- BUG: Drive letters in path unable to write to bad filename.
	- Templates don't list operations
	- Typedefs not listed (oovCommon/Filepaths)
	- function return type not listed
	- Multiple case statements without breaks appear nested.
	- Overloaded operations are not differentiated except const
	- Some statements not parsed: else (currently faked), goto, default, return, etc.
	- Save complete type info (explicit const, *, &, etc) in the XMI files?
	- Change class def/decl description in XMI file to find correct source module
		for empty classes.
	- ClassDrawer::drawDiagram not showing calls inside loops. CLang 3.4.1 works
- CMaker
	- Add include directories that are not components
	- Allow debug/release and cross compile in cmake

			specific-compiler-and-flags-when-final-compilation-stag- C++ parsing
- Journal
	- Allow more copies of diagrams?
- Component Diagrams
	- BUG: Doing build resets component diagram
	- Changing build settings/dependencies should update components
	- Add right click menu to remove component
- Class Diagrams
	- BUG: forward class definitions mess up source line numbers
	- find way to reduce strlen: std::allocator, std::less, std::basic_string<char> etc.
	  see ComponentBuilder
	- When class members are not shown, should be easy way to view members
	- Show return value for class methods
	- Set each class drawing preferences by whether component is the same.
	- Need either show classes that will be added, or undo, or multiple drawing copies
	- Add go to operation (callbacks to journal)
	- Allow saving editable drawings (save name and position of all classes, options)
	- Relation options should be per diagram.
	- reparenting preference options window messes up draw node options page.
	- Improve drawing, optimize graph for reduced line crosses
	- graph doesn't display types through typedefs (DiagramRect in DiagramGraph.h)
	- Show symbol key for diagrams
	- Add more diagram options (add depth=2, more generations)
	- Pointers/references/const not shown as part of types as text
	- Add class list context menu to allow adding single nodes/multiple nodes
		(two mouse buttons?, class properties?)
	- Show function return type relations (basically already handled by body decls)
	- Could allow multiple selection to add relations, remove, properties
	- Could have grid for class placement, option for grid size
	- Add filter for class list (GTK search feature exists)
- Sequence Diagrams
	- Should try to find top level function in diagram, may not be first class.
	- View source only working on top level operation
	- Improve drawing of nested calls to same class
	- shorten extremely long names
	- Add option to wrap long class names for denser diagrams
	- Diagram width not correct in svg diagrams for long operation names
	- Const calls aren't shown correctly for overloaded functions?
	- Add depth
	- Add option to display parameters.
	- Option for not replicating operation definitions if already displayed. New ... notation?
	- Calls through templates aren't displayed.
	- Allow rearranging class order?
- Analysis/Build System (Build not required for displaying diagrams)
	- Allow more project directory structures, dir tree
	- Build sometimes must have objects specified before or after other libs/objects
	- split source of libraries into separate file for each function for release mode
	- Component specific build args not used to recalculate crc's for rebuild
	- Separate oovcde-comptypes into user editable part (comp types), and file lists part
	- Replace oovcde-comps.txt in analysis directory with oovcde-extdir.txt file.
	- CMake file creator - Use analyze mode, read buildconfig(for crc), comptypes, incdeps
	- Changing package does not cause reanalysis (glib to gmodule)
	- Add -Wall, --analyzer
	- Cross compiling: http://www.cmake.org/Wiki/CMake_Cross_Compiling
	- date compares should not be for older, but even if date changed (in case of restore files)
	- When a source file changes, or new file, the dependency list is typically updated.
	  For now, if not, delete out/bld directory for clean build.
	- Cache file times or monitor file changes
	- For linux, don't getPackage if not in available list.
- Editor
	- improve go to definition: clang_getCursorUSR
	- Bug: view source displays wrong tab
	- Hover over tab should display full file path
	- tab name should change with file rename/save as.
	- Open include files
	- find declaration/definition
	- editor doesn't handle two files with same name
	- Prevent file overwrite of another editor at the same time
	- GtkPlug, XEmbed, Wayland? "gvim -f --socketid %w '%s'"

	- display column/character position
	- error highlighting
	- refactor-rename
- Debugger (In editor)
	- view variable results not parsed well for complex values
	- Adding variable to view should scroll to end
	- stopped, reason="watchpoint-trigger" doesn't enable Debug/Go
	- When view variables in call stack, show call stack location in editor?
	- Need to switch tabs and raise window when view source / hit breakpoint
	- Breakpoints not set in spawned executables?
	- Current exec position doesn't go away/update at some times
	- display variable doesn't work (wrong page?)
	- Debug data could display graphs, unicode, etc.
	- Debug data could be bound to functions in code
	- Could execute functions in code with parameters
	- remove breakpoint doesn't work
	- Control window requires that entering commands must enter on blank line
	- When build starts, should stop debugger
	- GDB docs are gdb.info, "The GDB/MI Interface"
