the tree in the wood - ver 1
There was a claw and a very fine claw,
As fine a claw as ever you did see.
And the claw was on the leg,
And the leg was on the chick,
And the chick was in the egg,
And the egg was in the nest,
And the nest was on the twig,
And the twig was on the branch,
And the branch was on the tree
And the tree was away down in the valley-o.

the tree in the wood - ver 2	
And then that bird it flew away,
As far as any eye could see.
The bird was in the egg,
The egg was in the nest,
The nest was on the branch,
The branch was on the limb,
The limb was on the tree,
The tree was in the wood.
And the green leaves grew around, around, around,
And the green leaves grew around.
