<h2>2013-07-2</h2>
Sequence diagrams are now created and can be saved as .SVG files. Class diagrams
now have many more features.

<h2>2013-07</h2>
The biggest new feature is that the graphs can now be saved into .SVG files,
which can be edited in Inkscape.
<p>
The C++ parser has been changed from a parser used in the Umbrello project
to the LLVM/Clang parser.  The Clang parser will correctly parse modern C++
variants, and is a complete C++ parser, which allows for
collecting any information that is desired for graphs.
</p><p>
The GUI has been changed from QT to GTK partly because of licensing and
because the number of dependencies seems to be smaller.
</p><p>
The graph layout has been changed from Boost to a custom genetic algorithm.
The Boost graph did not handle different sized nodes/classes easily.  The
genetic algorithm is not perfect, but gives a surprisingly quick initial
layout in most cases.

</p><h2>2010-01</h2>
This version used Qt, a C++ parser from the Umbrello project, and Boost graph.
<p>
The program goal has evolved a bit from the original to focus initially on the
graphs.  The main goal currently is to be able to quickly view class relations
and navigate between classes in systems with hundreds of classes.  There are also
new symbols for aiding understanding of which classes can modify other classes so
that review of certain relations can be performed quickly.
</p><p>
The boost graph and D-Bus usage cost a lot of time to develop due to various
problems.  Originally the boost graph was going to be based on
lists, but was changed to vectors because the implementation was easier.  The
D-Bus was difficult to use to handle arrays of structures, but eventually that
too was figured out.  Since the D-Bus support in MS Windows does not seem to be supported
well, the code was converted to shared memory.  The D-Bus code still exists in case
there is better support in the future.

</p><h2>Original Goals</h2>
The original purpose of this program was as an integrated software development
environment.  Since many CPU cores will be available, why not have many tasks
happening in the background while the programmer is working?  This means that
the program can be compiled, and documentation produced while the programmer
is developing code.  This includes code diagrams that are created in the background.
<p>
The implementation details of the separation of header files and source files
for C++ should be hidden from the developer.  This would require an intelligent
layout of source methods so that the user doesn't have to organize windows.
</p><p>
One idea was to use a genetic algorithm to create the graphs on a background thread.
The boost graph library would be used to create the original graph quickly, then
an icon would indicate when the improved graph was ready.  The programmer could
click on the icon to view the improved graph.  This has yet to be implemented.
</p><p>
There could also be a simple language for creating classes for either beginning
users, or as a convenience for advanced users.  The relations could be specified
by a language such as "Mary has-a little Lamb".  This could give a tigher understanding
for beginners between language and graphs.

</p><h2>More History</h2>
Originally the program was called Program Object Relationship Navigator, but the
web site was not getting any hits.  So a few programs were written to generate
random strings to make a name, and the programs all generated OOVCDE.  I may post
the source code later.  The pronunciaton is something like Oov-Kitty, and that is
the reason that the cat-eye is used for the scope and const relations symbol, and
that the Oov logo is an ice cream cone.
