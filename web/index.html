The oovcde project searches subdirectories and parses C++ code to
automatically create object oriented static class, zone, component, and
sequence diagrams, which allow easy navigation between diagrams and code.
<p/>
    <div id="example">
    The following diagram shows <a href="articles/ZoneDiagrams.html">zone diagrams</a>
    where each point in a circle is a class.  This shows hundreds of classes and their
    relations to each other.
    <br/>

    </div>
<p/>
Many of the created diagrams are similar to UML, but have optional additional
features. The diagrams can be edited manually and saved as .SVG files.
    <div id="example">
    The following diagram shows a class diagram that shows inheritance,
    aggregation, and class methods that use other classes.
    <br/>

    </div>
<p/>
    <div id="example">
    The following diagram shows a <a href="articles/PortionDiagrams.html">portion</a>
    diagram that shows the composition of a class.  It shows which methods use
    which member variables.
    <br/>
        <img src="articles/PortionImages/PortionSimpleExample.svg" width="300">
    </div>
<p/>
    <div id="example">
    The following diagram shows a sequence diagram that shows conditionals
    and method calls in classes.
    <br/>
        <img src="design/SeqDrawDiagram.svg" width="300">
    </div>
<p/>
Oovcde has a <a href="design/OovcdeBuildDesign.html">multithreaded build system</a>
    that uses dependency information from the analysis for easy setup, and also
    supports cross compiling.
    <div id="example">
    The following shows the build settings dialog.
    <br/>
        <img src="pics/Screenshot-CrossCompile.png" width="600">
    </div>
<p/>
There are other documents including Component diagrams and Include diagrams.
<p/>
The code editor has syntax highlighting, code completion, and a debugger.
    <div id="example">
    The following shows the code editor.
    <br/>
        <img src="pics/Screenshot-Editor.png" width="600">
    </div>
<p/>
<a href="articles/Complexity.html">Complexity measurements</a> are provided for
each method of a class.
    <div id="example">
    The following shows the complexity analysis results.
    <br/>
        <img src="pics/Screenshot-Complexity.png" width="600">
    </div>
<p/>
Code <a href="articles/TestCoverage.html">test coverage</a> instruments the
code and produces coverage information.
    <div id="example">
    The following shows the output from test coverage, and
	shows the number percentage of the file that was covered.
	In addition, it is possible to view how many times each
	block of code was run.
    <br/>
        <img src="pics/Screenshot-Coverage.png" width="600">
    </div>
<p/>
<a href="articles/DuplicateCode.html">Duplicate code</a> is found and listed.
    <div id="example">
    The following shows the output from duplicate code detection and
	shows the number of lines that match.
    <br/>
        <img src="pics/Screenshot-Duplicates.png" width="600">
    </div>
<p/>
There are other statistics displayed as well.

<h3>Project Goals</h3>
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Mainly for C++, or CLang related languages with header files and classes</li>
  <li>Visibility of code and design information</li>
  <li>Focused on programmer productivity with no hassles and papercuts</li>
  <li>Facilitate high quality design and code</li>
  <li>Use modern computer architectures, flash disks, multicore processing, work in the background</li>
  <li>Fast, lightweight, minimal dependencies</li>
  <li>Separate source files from output artifacts<br>
  </li>
</ul>
