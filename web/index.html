The oovcde project searches subdirectories and parses C++ code to
automatically create object oriented static class, component, zone, 
portion, sequence, and include diagrams, and allows easy
navigation between diagrams and code.
<p/>
    <div class="example">
    The following shows a <a href="articles/ZoneDiagrams.html">zone diagram</a>
    where each point in a circle is a class.  The diagram shows hundreds of
    classes and their relations to each other. By applying filters, very large projects
    can be analyzed.
    <br/>

    </div>
<p/>
Many of the created diagrams are similar to UML, but have optional additional
features. The diagrams can be edited manually and saved as .SVG files.
    <div class="example">
    The following shows a class diagram that shows inheritance,
    aggregation, and shows classes that are used internal to methods or
    as method parameters.
    <br/>
        <img src="design/CppParser.svg">
    </div>
<p/>
    <div class="example">
    The following shows a <a href="articles/PortionDiagrams.html">portion</a>
    diagram that shows the composition of a class.  It shows which methods use
    which member variables.
    <br/>
        <img src="articles/PortionImages/PortionSimpleExample.svg">
    </div>
<p/>
    <div class="example">
    The following shows a sequence diagram that shows guard conditions
    and method calls in classes.  The guard condition nesting is shown
    along the lifelines.
    <br/>
        <img src="design/SeqDrawDiagram.svg">
    </div>
<p/>
Oovcde has a <a href="design/OovcdeBuildDesign.html">multithreaded build system</a>
    that uses dependency information from the analysis for easy setup, and also
    supports cross compiling.
    <div class="example">
    The following shows the build settings dialog.
    <br/>
        <img src="pics/Screenshot-CrossCompile.png" width="600">
    </div>
<p/>
There are other documents including Component diagrams and Include diagrams.
<p/>
The code editor has syntax highlighting, code completion, and a debugger.
    <div class="example">
    The following shows the code editor.
    <br/>
        <img src="pics/Screenshot-Editor.png" width="600">
    </div>
<p/>
<a href="articles/Complexity.html">Complexity measurements</a> are provided for
each method of a class.
    <div class="example">
    The following shows the complexity analysis results.
    <br/>
        <img src="pics/Screenshot-Complexity.png" width="600">
    </div>
<p/>
Code <a href="articles/TestCoverage.html">test coverage</a> instruments the
code and produces coverage information.
    <div class="example">
    The following shows the output from test coverage, and
	shows the number percentage of the file that was covered.
	In addition, it is possible to view how many times each
	block of code was run.
    <br/>
        <img src="pics/Screenshot-Coverage.png" width="600">
    </div>
<p/>
<a href="articles/DuplicateCode.html">Duplicate code</a> is found and listed.
    <div class="example">
    The following shows the output from duplicate code detection and
	shows the number of lines that match.
    <br/>
        <img src="pics/Screenshot-Duplicates.png" width="600">
    </div>
<p/>
There are other statistics displayed as well.
<br/>For more information, see the
<a href="userguide/oovcdeuserguide.html">User Guide</a>, and for an example
of design documents that can be created with Oovcde, see the

<h3>Project Goals</h3>
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Mainly for C++, or CLang related languages with header files and classes</li>
  <li>Visibility of code and design information</li>
  <li>Focused on programmer productivity with no hassles and papercuts</li>
  <li>Facilitate high quality design and code</li>
  <li>Use modern computer architectures, flash disks, multicore processing, work in the background</li>
  <li>Fast, lightweight, minimal dependencies</li>
  <li>Separate source files from output artifacts<br>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
<h3><A name="DownloadSection">Downloads</h3>
Oovcde is available in binary form from 
<a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/oovcde/">SourceForge</a> or from
<a href="https://github.com/animatedb/oovcde/releases">Github</a>.
To build from source, the easiest way is to use CMake by following the
instructions in the <a href="https://github.com/animatedb/oovcde#download">Github download section</a>.
