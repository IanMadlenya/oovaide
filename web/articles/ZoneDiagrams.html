<h1>Viewing C++ Project Cohesion (Code Zone Diagrams)</h1>
Have you ever wanted to view hundreds or thousands of classes of a project at
one time and their dependencies on each other?
Traditional class diagrams can show in the tens of classes, but often times
these diagrams can be too difficult to understand relationships quickly.
<p />
A different way of viewing these classes is to use a circle diagram where
all of the classes are a single point on the circle. The dependencies
are displayed as lines between the classes.  The classes are grouped by
directories.
<br />

<p />
This first example shows a small project, but what if we need to display a project
such as LLVM? Showing lines between all classes is too much (See the LLVM diagram below),
so only lines between directories are displayed where the classes are related. The
arrows can be turned on to indicate dependency direction.
<br />
<embed src="ZoneImages/ZoneOovcdeComponents.svg" type="image/svg+xml">
<p />
This makes it easier to see that oovcde and oovEdit are both related to oovGuiCommon,
and oovCommon, but the other components are not.
<p />
<h2>Viewing the LLVM project</h2>
Showing all classes for the LLVM project is pretty messy.  I have never looked at
the source for LLVM, so let's see what we can learn.
<br />
<embed src="ZoneImages/ZoneLlvmClasses.svg" type="image/svg+xml">
<br />
Viewing just the directory relations is more manageable. It is still messy,
but now we start to get a view of the whole project.
<br />
<embed src="ZoneLlvmComponents.svg" type="image/svg+xml">
<br />
Since this project has a directory structure that looks like this:
<pre>
    include/llvm/
        Analysis
        AST
    lib/
        Analysis
        AST
</pre>
Lets group this so that the include and lib directories are mapped together,
and filter out examples, tests, and tools.
<br />
<embed src="ZoneImages/ZoneLlvmIncLib.svg" type="image/svg+xml">
<br />
There are an awful lot of targets that we are not interested in. Lets dump them.
<br />
<embed src="ZoneImages/ZoneLlvmIncLibNoTarget.svg" type="image/svg+xml">
<br />
Now turning on all classes will show more of the cohesion between classes.
<br />
<embed src="ZoneImages/ZoneLlvmIncLibNoTargetAllClasses.svg" type="image/svg+xml">
<br />
Some of the interesting aspects are:
<ul>
  <li>There are lots of relations inside of CodeGen to itself. This indicates
	pretty good cohesion, although CodeGen is large.</li>
  <li>The Support library has very few connections to other classes.
	We may need to turn on function relations to see if the library is
	well used.</li>
  <li>There is a lot of coupling between IR and Transform.</li>
  <li>There is a lot of coupling between MC and AsmPrinter. Looking up MC on
	the web indicates it stands for Machine Code, so this coupling makes sense.</li>
</ul>
<p/>
So let's look at the MC/AsmPrinter relations in more detail. Turning on the dependency
indications shows that the AsmPrinter classes are dependent on the include/llvm/MC
directory and not the other way around.

<br />
<embed src="ZoneImages/ZoneLlvmMcAsmPrinterComps.svg" type="image/svg+xml">
<br />
 
There are a few other directories that are not related to AsmPrinter such as lib/MC/MCParser,
so we'll turn them off which now shows all classes related between include/llvm/MC and
AsmPrinter.
<br />
<embed src="ZoneImages/ZoneLlvmMcAsmPrinterClasses.svg" type="image/svg+xml">
<br />

There is a relationship between SrcLineInfo and MCSymbol, so switching to
a class view diagram should show this.

<br />
<embed src="ZoneImages/ZoneLlvmSrcLineInfo.svg" type="image/svg+xml">
<br />
<p />
The actual code looks like the following:
<pre>
class SrcLineInfo {
  unsigned Line;     // Source line number.
  unsigned Column;   // Source column.
  unsigned SourceID; // Source ID number.
  MCSymbol *Label;   // Label in code ID number.
public:
  SrcLineInfo(unsigned L, unsigned C, unsigned S, MCSymbol *label)
      : Line(L), Column(C), SourceID(S), Label(label) {}

  // Accessors
  unsigned getLine() const { return Line; }
  unsigned getColumn() const { return Column; }
  unsigned getSourceID() const { return SourceID; }
  MCSymbol *getLabel() const { return Label; }
};
</pre>
