    <title>Viewing Object Oriented Project Dependencies</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>Viewing C++ Project Cohesion (Code Zone Diagrams)</h1>
    Have you ever wanted to view hundreds or thousands of classes of a project
    at one time and their dependencies on each other? Traditional class diagrams
    can show in the tens of classes, but often times these diagrams can be too
    difficult to understand relationships quickly.
    <p> A different way of viewing these classes is to use a circle diagram
      where all of the classes are a single point on the circle. The classes are
      grouped by directories. The dependencies are displayed as lines between
      the classes. The lines are colored by the provider directory. <br>
      <embed src="ZoneImages/ZoneOovcdeClasses.svg" type="image/svg+xml"> </p>
    <p> This first example shows the small Oovcde project that parses C++ to
      make these diagrams, but what if we need to display a million line project
      such as LLVM? Showing lines between all classes is too much, so only lines
      between directories are displayed where the classes are related. The
      arrows can be turned on to indicate dependency direction. The following
      diagram is the same project as the diagram above, but only shows class
      dependencies between directories.<br>
      <embed src="ZoneImages/ZoneOovcdeComponents.svg" type="image/svg+xml"> </p>
    <p> This makes it easier to see that oovcde and oovEdit are both related to
      oovGuiCommon, and oovCommon, but the other components are not. </p>
    <h2>Viewing the LLVM project</h2>
    Showing all classes for the LLVM project is pretty messy since it has over
    3000 classes and somewhere near a million lines of code. I have never looked
    at the source for LLVM, so let's see what we can learn. <br>
    <embed src="ZoneImages/ZoneLlvmClasses.svg" type="image/svg+xml"> <br>
    Viewing just the directory relations is more manageable. It is still messy,
    but now we start to get a view of the whole project. <br>
    <embed src="ZoneImages/ZoneLlvmComponents.svg" type="image/svg+xml"> <br>
    Since this project has a directory structure that looks like this:
    <pre>    include/llvm/
        Analysis
        AST
        ...
    lib/
        Analysis
        AST
        ...
    </pre>
    Lets group this so that the include and lib directories are mapped together,
    and filter out examples, tests, tools, and utilities. <br>
    <embed src="ZoneImages/ZoneLlvmIncLib.svg" type="image/svg+xml"> <br>
    There are an awful lot of targets that we are not interested in. Lets dump
    them. <br>
    <embed src="ZoneImages/ZoneLlvmIncLibNoTarget.svg" type="image/svg+xml"> <br>
    Now turning on all classes will show more of the cohesion between classes in
    the directories. <br>
    <embed src="ZoneImages/ZoneLlvmIncLibNoTargetAllClasses.svg" type="image/svg+xml">
    <br>
    Some of the interesting aspects are:
    <ul>
      <li>There are lots of relations inside of CodeGen to itself. This
        indicates pretty good cohesion, although CodeGen is large.</li>
      <li>The Support library has very few connections to other classes. We may
        need to turn on function relations to see if the library is well used.</li>
      <li>There is a lot of coupling between IR and Transform.</li>
      <li>There is a lot of coupling between MC and AsmPrinter. Looking up MC on
        the web indicates it stands for Machine Code, so this coupling makes
        sense.</li>
    </ul>
    <p> So let's look at the MC/AsmPrinter relations in more detail. Turning on
      the dependency indications shows that the AsmPrinter classes are dependent
      on the include/llvm/MC directory and not the other way around. <br>
      <embed src="ZoneImages/ZoneLlvmMcAsmPrinterComps.svg" type="image/svg+xml">
      <br>
      There are a few other directories that are not related to
      CodeGen/AsmPrinter such as lib/MC/MCParser, so we'll turn them off which
      now shows all classes related between include/llvm/MC and AsmPrinter. <br>
      <embed src="ZoneImages/ZoneLlvmMcAsmPrinterClasses.svg" type="image/svg+xml">
      <br>
      There is a relationship between DIELabel and MCSymbol, so switching to a
      class view diagram should show this. <br>
      <embed src="ZoneImages/ZoneLlvmDIELabelClass.svg" type="image/svg+xml">
    <p> This diagram shows that DIELabel in AsmPrinter has a member that is an
      MCSymbol from the MC directory, so the AsmPrinter is truly dependent on
      the MC directory. </p>
    <p> The actual DIELabel class code with comments removed looks like the
      following: </p>
    <pre>    class DIELabel : public DIEValue {
      const MCSymbol *Label;

    public:
      explicit DIELabel(const MCSymbol *L) : DIEValue(isLabel), Label(L) {}
      void EmitValue(AsmPrinter *AP, dwarf::Form Form) const override;
      const MCSymbol *getValue() const { return Label; }
      unsigned SizeOf(AsmPrinter *AP, dwarf::Form Form) const override;
      static bool classof(const DIEValue *L) { return L-&gt;getType() == isLabel; }

    #ifndef NDEBUG
      void print(raw_ostream &amp;O) const override;
    #endif
    };
    </pre>
    Displaying the sequence or operation diagram for the print function of
    DIELabel shows the following: <br>
    <embed src="ZoneImages/ZoneLlvmDIELabelPrintSeq.svg" type="image/svg+xml"> <br>
    <p> The print member function calls the MCSymbol::getName() method. The code
      looks like the following: </p>
    <pre>    void DIELabel::print(raw_ostream &amp;O) const {
      O &lt;&lt; "Lbl: " &lt;&lt; Label-&gt;getName();
    }
    </pre>
    <p> This is about as far as we can drill in today. Next time, the atom. </p>
