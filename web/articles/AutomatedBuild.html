  <h1>Automated Build System</h1>

	Have you ever thought that too much time is spent on setting
	up projects for building programs?
	<p/>
	Why do we have to manually set up include paths?  Why do we
	have to manually set up libraries for linking and define which
	libraries use which other libraries?
	What is the minimal amount of information required to build a program?
	<p/>
	The OovAide program must be easy to set up to analyze programs that
	may be built using many different build systems. For this reason it
	is important that it is easy to set up.
	<p/>
	In order to allow the programmer to set up us little as possible,
	modern systems should find this information automatically, and
	update the information if any files have changed.  There are
	some problems doing this for all programs, but for many programs,
	the constraints and tasks are not that difficult.
	<p/>
	We do not need yet another build system, but maybe some of these
	features will someday be incorporated into more intelligent build systems.

    <h1>C++ Automated Build</h1>
    <h2>Include Paths</h2>
	Some of the difficulties with automatically finding include
	paths are described below.
	<ul>
	<li>C++ code is difficult to parse. This problem is pretty
	much solved by using a modern parser such as the CLang parser,
	and building some code around them to search for include paths.</li>
	<li>C++ macros can alter the files that are included. Two different
	include files can include a single include files with a different
	#define setting so that the included file has different include
	dependency results.
	Many projects do not have this problem at least for the header files
	that are defined within the project.  The future C++ module feature
	may be required to solve the macro problem for difficult projects.</li>
	<li>
	In C++, an include path	can be something like "&lt;gtk/gtk.h&gt;",
	which means that the include directory flag given to the compiler
	has to specify a directory one level higher in the directory tree.</li>
	<li>Many include files within a project could have the same name.</li>
	<li>Most projects rely on external project include paths, such
	as C++ standard libraries, or some other framework. At the moment these
	cannot be found automatically, at least not on all operating systems.
	</li>
	</ul>

    <h2>Setting up Build Tools</h2>
	It would also be nice if the build system automatically found the
	build tools. For example, it may search for g++ or for clang++. On
	Windows or Linux, it may search the "Path" environment variable, or on
	may search some standard directories.  In addition, some compiler
	options may be setup by default for debug and release versions.

    <h2>Specifying Source Code Grouping</h2>
	<p/>
	<embed src="../userguide/ExampleSourceTree.svg" type="image/svg+xml">
	<p/>
	For simple projects, it may be that all source code under a
	directory is used to build a single executable. For other projects,
	there can be many components of different types, such as static
	library, dynamic library or executable.  Each dynamic
	library or executable can use any static library.  At the moment,
	there is no way to automatically determine which source code in
	different directories are used to build a component. This must
	require some additional information from the programmer, but usually
	there should be no need to list all source or header files, or to
	specify the dependencies.

    <h2>Libraries</h2>
	In some operating systems, the linker may require the libraries to be
	listed in order.  This is not a big problem and is easily solved
	with available tools.

    <h2>External Packages</h2>
	In addition to external project include files, there are typically also
	external libraries required by projects.  These projects may also
	require additional compile or link time switches.  Under Linux, there
	can be quite a bit of information available, but under Windows, the
	task is a bit more difficult.


<h1>OovAide Build System</h1>
	The original purpose of OovAide is to be able to investigate projects
	where there is minimal knowledge of the project. There may be build files
	present, but there are so many build systems that it is impossible
	to handle them all.  OovAide at some point may be able to read a
	few, at least for the purpose of analysis, but it does not currently.
	<p/>
	An attempt was made to build an easy to use build system in the
	OovAide program.  This solution may not work for very large or
	complicated projects, but does work on projects that have multiple
	include paths, external packages, and builds multiple binary components.
	<p/>
	The following sections are defined roughly in the order that
	a programmer would go through to set up a project for building
	using the OovAide program.  Performing only analysis using OovAide
	only requires a subset of the steps defined here.
	<p/>
	OovAide allows specifying custom compile switches for the project.
	OovAide actually runs a command line build program called
	oovBuilder, which allows performing builds from the command line.
	OovAide also runs many of the build tasks in parallel by multitasking
	the processes.

    <h2>Specify Project Code Location</h2>
	The programmer must select a single source root directory for all of
	the source code that will be in the project.  It is possible to
	specify exclusion directories within the source root directory to
	specify directories that should not be analyzed or built.

    <h2>Setting Up Build Tools</h2>
	The OovAide program searches for the g++ and clang++ tools. It does
	this differently on Windows and Linux. It also requires the ar and
	nm tools for finding library dependencies.
	<p/>
	On Linux, the system include paths must be found. OovAide runs
	the compiler to query the built-in include paths. On Windows, the
	include files are supplied with OovAide, and do not need to be
	found using the compiler.

    <h2>Setting up Build Configurations</h2>
	OovAide defines the standard Debug and Release configurations
	and sets up some default compiler switches for each configuration.
	The goal here is that external packages only need to be set
	once, and every configuration will use the common arguments.
	OovAide also supports adding more configurations for things such
	as cross compiling, but at the moment, a separate project may
	be required if the configurations are too different.
	<p/>
	Typically the external packages must be defined differently on Linux
	or Windows because the package systems are not the same on
	all systems.
	<p/>
	There is much room for improvement here.

    <h2>External Packages</h2>
	The advantage of having predefined external packages is that
	the programmer can select a single name such as MySQL or
	wxWidgets, and the appropriate compiler switches
	(with include paths), link switches, and link libraries can
	be used by a project. The OovAide program reads the package
	details and sends the appropriate information to the compiler or linker.
	<p/>
	On Linux, the pkgconfig program provides definitions for many
	popular packages. The pkgconfig program is on many Linux systems,
	and defines the compile and link information needed to use the
	package. The OovAide GUI provides a simple way to select external
	packages to add to the program.
	<p/>
	On Windows,
	a similar interface is provided for selecting libraries, but there is
	no common database that provides definitions of external libraries.
	A few library definitions are provided by OovAide, but others can be
	added by the programmer.  This is not a good long term solution, but
	there is not a common package manager on all systems yet.

    <h2>Directory Scan</h2>
	The OovAide program scans the directories under the source root
	directory to find all of the source and header files.
	<p/>
	The OovAide project assumes that an external editor may have been
	used to edit the files, and performs a directory scan on the whole
	source root directory tree in order to find modified files.
	This could be optimized in the future by performing directory
	monitoring, since scanning all directories may limit the use for
	very large projects.

    <h2>Specifying Source Code Grouping</h2>
	The following directory tree will be used to discuss some
	common scenarios.
	<p/>
	<embed src="../userguide/ExampleSourceTree.svg" type="image/svg+xml">
	<p/>
	An important point to remember is that the OovAide grouping mechanism
	is used for grouping source files into components. OovAide will set
	include paths for header files no matter where they are as long as
	the file names are unique.
	<p/>
	OovAide uses a simple method for defining components.  Any directory
	in the source root directory can be designated as a component.
	<p/>
	Some of the grouping rules:
	<ul>
    	<li>A component at any level of the tree will be built using all
	  source files in all subdirectories that are not defined as a
	  component. In this diagram, the top nodes ("Dir Root", "Dir A",
	  and "Dir B-2") are defined as components.</li>
	<li>The groupings do not determine where header files can be found.
	  They only determine which source files are compiled into the
	  component. Header files can be anywhere and will be automatically
	  found during analysis.</li>
	<li>Component "Dir A" could be a library, which will be linked into
	  other components automatically.</li>
	</ul>

    <h3>Example 1</h3>
	In the first example, "Dir Root" is defined as an executable component.
	Include files could be present in any directory, and these directories
	will be supplied to the compiler in order to build the object files
	from the source files.  All object files will be linked into the
	executable. 

    <h3>Example 2</h3>
	This example starts from the first example, and defines "Dir A" as
	a static library component.  This means that the programmer only has
	to select one item in the directory tree as a component, and
	OovAide will build a static library and link it into the executable
	without specifying and source paths, etc.  OovAide provides
	the StaticLib example that is similar to this.
	<a href="../userguide/examples.html">Examples</a>

    <h3>Example 3</h3>
	This example starts from the first example, and defines "Dir A" as
	a run-time library component.  This is not as nice as example 2,
	since the source code must be modified to define an interface
	and use the interface for the run-time bindings.

    <h3>Example 4</h3>
	A good example of a slightly more complex system is the OovAide
	project. It contains multiple executables (OovAide, OovBuilder,
	ClangView, OovCMaker, OovCovInstr, OovCppParser),
	multiple static libraries (OovCommon, and OovGuiCommon),
	a Java program (OovJavaParser), and a run-time library (OovDbWriter).
	There are include files in all of these component directories,
	and they are all properly built.

    <h2>Analysis</h2>
  	The CLang parser is run on all C++ files to generate include
	dependencies. The include dependencies are used to build object
	files, and to determine when they must be rebuilt when a source
	file changes.  The include dependencies are also used to determine
	which external packages are used by each component.
	<p/>
	A CRC is used on the command line switches to determine when
	the analysis and include dependencies must be updated. A separate
	directory is used for each CRC so that switching between settings
	is faster.
	<p/>
	While parsing the C++ files, include flags are set for all directories
	in the project that contain header files so that the CLang compiler
	can function correctly. In addition, OOvAide specifies the parent
	and grandparent directories so that relative paths such as &lt;gtk/gtk.h&gt;
	will compile. The number of include directories may be a problem on
	some versions of Windows for larger projects since the command line
	length may be limited to 32767 characters.
	<p/>
	It would be nice if CLang could request
	include flags dynamically during parsing to reduce possible problems
	that too many include directories could create.
	<p/>
	During the actual compile, only the include files that are
	required are specified as directories for faster compilation.
	<p/>
	At the moment, if the project is changed in a major manner,
	the conservative approach is taken, and all files are rebuilt.

    <h2>Build</h2>
	The build performs the directory scan to see what which files
	were modified. The file extensions are used to determine which
	tool to run on each file.  The nm tool is used to find the names
	in internal and external project libraries to determine library
	dependencies and link order.  Only files that are out of date are
	built.
	<p/>
	The include dependency directories are used to determine which
	external package libraries are needed to build a component that
	is linked.  OovAide does have constraints that the header file
	have to be unique in some cases in order to prevent linking the
	wrong library or finding the wrong include during a compile.  This
	is typically not a problem since most external packages have few
	files that are included directly in a project.
	<p/>
	At the moment, all project libraries are included in the link. This
	does not seem to cost much time since the unused libraries will be last
	during the link.  This rule may be changed in the future.
	<p/>

	More build details can be seen at
	<a href="../userguide/oovaidebuildhelp.html">OovAide Build Help</a>
	or 
	<a href="../design/OovaideBuildDesign.html">OovAide Build Design</a>

    <h2>Build Variables</h2>
	A base variable	can be defined as having a value, then it can either
	be reassigned or appended to for certain build states.
	<p/>
	Variable as stored in a project file:
		<table border="1">
		<tr><th>Entity</th><th>Description</th><th>Example</th></tr>
		<tr><td>Var name</td><td>An identifier</td><td>CppArgs</td></tr>
		<tr><td>Filter</td><td>[filtername : filtervalue & filtername : filtervalue]</td>
			<td>[comp:oovaide & plat:Windows]</td></tr>
		<tr><td>Function</td><td>Set(=), insert(^), or append(+) to a variable</td><td>+</td></tr>
		<tr><td>Value separator</td><td>|</td><td>|</td></tr>
		<tr><td>Value</td><td>any string or compound values</td><td>-lnk-Wl,--subsystem,windows;</td></tr>
		</table>
	<br/>
	The following are filters that are prebuilt into the program.
		<table border="1">
		<tr><th>Filter Name</th><th>Possible Values</th></tr>
		<tr><td>mode</td><td>Analyze, Build</td></tr>
		<tr><td>plat</td><td>Linux, Windows</td></tr>
		<tr><td>cfg</td><td>Analysis, Debug, Release, [custom]</td></tr>
		<tr><td>comp</td><td>Any component name within the project</td></tr>
		</table>
	Another filter that may be added is
	filetype (cpp,c,asm,obj,lib/java). Also coverage does not have filters yet.
	<p/>
	The following is an example configuration file.
	<pre>
	CppArgs[]=|-c;-x;c++;-std=c++11;
	CppArgs[cfg:Debug]+|-O0;-g3;
	</pre>

	The previous configuration would result in the following. The arguments are shown as
	separated with semicolons. This shows that release mode is using the base
	variable arguments, and the Debug mode has extra arguments appended.

	<table border="1">
	<tr><th>Mode</th><th>Flags</th></tr>
	<tr><td>Debug</td><td>-c;-x;c++;-std=c++11;-O0;-g3;</td></tr>
	<tr><td>Release</td><td>-c;-x;c++;-std=c++11;</td></tr>
	</table>
	<p/>
	The C++ arguments will be given to the compiler before the project include
	directories. This can be used to specify directories to eliminate the problem
	of duplicate header file names.

    <h2>Some Future Tasks</h2>
	For a broader vision, see the Completely Redesigned Build below.
	Optimize the use of the CLang compiler. The CLang compiler is invoked multiple times.
	<ul>
	<li>The editor uses the compiler in order to perform syntax highlighting
	and to find symbols for code completion.  This is fairly transparent
	to the user since it is performed on a background thread.</li>
	<li>The compiler is used to generate include dependencies and analysis
	information.</li>
	<li>The source code is compiled into object files.</li>
	</ul>
	<p/>
	Running the compiler multiple times could be a bit of a speed problem,
	but it is alleviated since OovAide performs multitasking for the
	build processes.
	It doesn't appear that CLang supports analyzing and building at
	the same time using the C-Index interface to the compiler. In the future,
	the analysis information could be generated in the editor after it is
	detected that the editor has has compiled some source code cleanly.
	Performing the compilation automatically could also be performed, but
	makes more sense when a source file is being compiled rather than a header file.
	There is definitely room for improvement here.
	<p/>
	The other major problem that could be partially solved is include
	files that have the same name.  The source code grouping could be used
	to first find include files within the current component.  This still
	may not be enough for some projects though.

    <h1>Java Automated Build</h1>
	OovAide can also build very simple Java programs (generally a single jar)
	that are in the same directories along with C++ files.

    <h2>Directory Scan</h2>
	While the scan for C++ files is run under the source root
	directory, the java files are also found.

    <h2>Specifying Source Code Grouping</h2>
	The same directory setup is used as the C++ grouping.  The component
	types that are used for java are "Library Jar" or "Executable Jar".
	The difference is that a Manifest.txt file is required in any
	directory that is defined as an "Executable Jar". The manifest must
	have the Main-Class attribute set. See OovJavaParser directory
	as an example.

    <h2>Setting up Build Configurations</h2>
	The Java setup allows setting up the class path to allow
	references to external jars, and other arguments.

    <h2>Analysis and Build</h2>
	At the moment, the java parser is used to find the include dependencies.
	This may mean that the files must compile successfully in order for
	full analysis to be performed. The jar files are not built in any
	order at this time, so if one is dependent on another, sorry.
	A workaround is to define multiple OovAide projects, and to define
	exclude directories if needed.
	<p/>
	The correct way to fix this would be to have a pass that finds
	include dependencies before performing analysis or builds.  I am not
	sure if the Java parser supports this, but it appears that it might.
	In addition, the jar
	files have to be built in order which presents some interesting
	problems to solve in order to support multitasking.

  <h1>Completely Redesigned Build</h1>
	The following are ideas for a completely redesigned build after
	presenting this article on Reddit. Many people think that the
	current build systems (make or cmake) are fine.
	My opinion is that the current build systems have the following
	problems.
	<ul>
	  <li>There is too much manual setup</li>
	  <li>They could be much faster</li>
	  <li>Conditional logic should be reduced or removed for simplicity</li>
	</ul>
	A couple of unique features to OovAide is that the build should
	be extremely easy to set up so that analysis can be performed on
	unknown projects or projects with strange build systems.
	Another point is that analysis can be performed even when a
	successful build is not possible.
	<p/>
	There are multiple phases to a more automated build. These phases are
	not listed in exact order since some phases are iterative. For example,
	some types of directory grouping may be done at any time.
	<ul>
	<li>
	  Build Setup
	  <ul>
	    <li>Setting up tool information</li>
	    <li>Download externally required packages</li>
	  </ul>
	</li>
	<li>Editor creates or modifies source files (Requires include paths)</li>
	<li>Component identification/directory grouping</li>
	<li>
	  Build
	  <ul>
	    <li>Either the build scans for modified files, or
		performs directory monitoring, or is told by
		the editor which files have changed.</li>
	    <li>Find include dependencies (using something like -M flags)</li>
	    <li>Build files/components by running final commands
		(executables require running nm on libraries for
		determining link order)</li>
	  </ul>
	  Scanning for new files and finding dependencies does not need
	  to be done as often as the final build phase.</li>
	  The final build phase does not need to scan all files
	  to determine what to build.
	  </li>
	</ul>

	Implementation Goals.
	<ul>
	<li>Try to default in standard ways first, then allow overriding
	  by user.  For example, default to including all include paths
	  in project, then if duplicate include files, allow user to
	  specify order. Default to building all files in recursive directories.
	  This can reduce file size and complexity.</li>
	<li>Reduce the required number of build files. This reduces the complexity
	  for projects (especially for small projects), and increases build speed.</li>
	<li>Reduce directory scanning (like -M) so that they do not need to be
	  done for every build.</li>
	<li>Allow building debug/release, cross compile, platform, etc.</li>
	<li>Multiple targets? Allow building things like doxygen, C assembly, etc?</li>
	<li>At the moment, this build does not support building arbitrary files
	  using rules like ninja.</li>
	</ul>

	Some implementation details.
	<ul>
	<li>Implementation solution for overriding defaults. For include directories
	  and build tool arguments, this is done using indexed filtered variables</li>
	<li>When do build files need to be loaded and how many
	  need to be loaded? (build files per component)
	  Location of build file has no meaning. Build files are all combined into
	  a single build mass.  Separated build files may be useful if variables
	  can be inherited/extended from parent build files.  This may not be
	  useful until variables can be used from other variables?
	  There should not need to be a build file in each component, but there
	  can be to provide sub-projects that can be included into various
	  parent projects. Parent build files define settings for child build
	  files. Add and subtract from previous settings. Conditional for linux/windows
	  Parent build "import" child builds.
	  </li>
	<li>Can the build files stay loaded and be
	  reexecuted for each source file update? Saves scanning for new files.</li>
	<li>Build files required to determine what to build should
	  be small, then other files can be loaded to build certain parts?</li>
	<li>Dependency generation must be performed before build phase
	  for Java?</li>
	<li>Analysis, docs, etc. output should be generated after build output?
	  Include dependency analysis should be done by editor. Include dependency
	  info should be saved by directory? Derived from C++ modules?
	  C++ modules created automatically if specified? The editor can indicate to
	  the build system whether the include dependencies need to be updated, and
	  implicitly when a file has been created or changed.
	  </li>
	<li>Allow specifying include paths that must be included first. Allow
	  user to choose from multiple duplicates? How to specify order?</li>
	<li>Library dependency ordering - when/how does it happen, what are rules?</li>
	<li>All stored paths that are within a project should be relative.</li>
	<li>Should allow external projects to be on different drives. (Windows)</li>
	<li>Still two module proposals: Microsoft open-std.org,
	  CLang module.modulemap, std.vector. Neither module proposal specifies
	  location of external dependencies? Improved import may handle dup names?</li>
	<li>Does CMake get include directories from library specifications?</li>
	<li>Must support debug/release output.</li>
	<li>The new C++ module system should be used. This is an extra
	  file in the source directories that can specify include
	  dependencies, etc.  This looks like it can be generated
	  by compilers, but it is too late in the build phases.</li>
	<li>Components / grouping should allow specifying wildcard source
	  lists</li>
	<li>To solve the duplicate header file problem, rely on C++ modules?
	  Worst case manual override?</li>
	<li>Should skip builds if input requirements (packages) do not exist</li>
	<li>Ninja ideas:
	  <ul>
	    <li>Ninja is a low level build program (the last build phase). It does not
	      find packages like CMake. It does support building packages?</li>
	    <li>
	      Ninja is good for complete builds.  It seems like it could
	      be faster if it was told which parts of a program to build.
	      I am pretty sure it must load all ninja files to do a build.
	      This http://www.aosabook.org/en/posa/ninja.html says that there are
	      10 MB of ninja files to do a chrome build. This
		https://ninja-build.org/manual.html says it takes less than
		a second to start a build.
	      It could use default mechanisms to reduce file size. Such as
	      defaulting to *.cpp (more implicit rather than explicit) for a build rule.
	      It seems like it could be faster also if it did not use
	      the -M flags and could have two stages for scan/build.
	      </li>
	    <li>Fixed variables can be defined. These are basically
	      literal strings that can define command names, and
	      command arguments. Variables inherit from parent file.
	      There are no conditionals for platform, debug/release, etc.</li>
	    <li>Targets allow specifying which build outputs to build.</li>
	    <li>&quot;rules&quot; provide common information about
	      building a file type. Rules support variable substitution
	      and extracting parts of the output filename and input filenames.
	      $in has an extension but $out does not?</li>
	    <li>&quot;build&quot; applies the rules to a specific output file.</li>
	    <li>I view ninja type files as intermediate files. So they should
	      not be stored in source directories. Dependency info like C++
	      modules can be stored in source directories.</li>
	  </ul>
	  </li>
	<li>Bug fix: Support multiple drives?</li>
	</ul>
    <h2>Evolve OovAide Build</h2>

	Some of the following may be already implemented in the latest versions of OovAide.
	<ul>
	  <li>Dependencies - Add dependency dialog per component/dir.
	    Clear and find, if manually set up, should builder ever scan?
	    In future, could scan from within selected directories.
	    Add external and internal project dependency scanning.
	    First only add internal dependencies?
	    Add Comp-intDeps[] to oovaide-comptypes.txt for internal dependencies?
	    If empty, use scan. Scan or CMake results go to Comp-scannedIntDeps or pulled out of incdeps?
	    Allow different file types in same directory? Dependencies different?
	    OovBuilder can scan or use CMake files to set up manual dependencies.
	    GUI reads incdeps to assist updating manual dependencies?
		NEW: ComponentFinder::getComponentIncludeDirs()
	    </li>
	  <li>Clean - Should be per component/dir. Add dependency/scan cleaning?</li>
	  <li>Build CRC - Fix to handle changed external projects per component?
	    CRC per component? Other option is that external packages must be
	    set, and components can select from external packages.</li>
	  <li>Projects - Add import for child components. Import only defines
	    a way to optionally separate definitions so that multiple parents can
	    import a child file. Info from oovaide-comptypes.txt file gets moved into
	    oovaide.txt. oovaide-tmp-compsources.txt changes</li>
	  <li>Change build configurations to allow Windows/Linux settings - causes
	    change in External Packages for Windows/Linux Analysis</li>
	  <li>Types of tools: convert=compile,analyze,coverage combine=lib(.obj),link(.lib)
	    javac - For each component *.java converts to *.class
	    link - combines lib and obj files
	    java dups flag is handled strangely, analysis requires ordering by component
	    jar dependencies
	    </li>
	  <li>Rules - JavaAnalysis
	    $javaToolPath $javaArgs -cp $tools.jar $javaAnalyzerTool $in $srcRootDir $analDir $args
	    </li>
	  <li>Option - OovAide needs option for placement of dependency information in
		source or build dirs?</li>
	  <li>Option - Need option for when to rescan (when editor changes file). Allow
	    manual rescan or clean. Clean by component.</li>
	  <li>Add option to specify relative include path levels? #include <gtk/gtk.h></li>
	  <li>Read CMake files to create build files. add_subdirectory</li>
	  <li>IncDeps - oovaide-incdeps.txt is specific for each component.
	    There are two types of incdeps - compiler generated (files), and user
	    specified (paths, previously oovaide-extdirs.txt)</li>
	  <li>Incdeps - Change incdeps file and other build files to use internal
	    directory variables to reduce filepath duplication to reduce file sizes</li>
	  <li>oovaide-extdirs.txt (initial include paths) is specific for each component
	    or defined as variable that builds inherit</li>
	  <li>Java - external packages should be specified by component, sets
	    classpath</li>
	</ul>
