<h1>Automated Build System</h1>
	Have you ever thought that too much time is spent on setting
	up projects for building programs?
	<p/>
	This is modern times and we build programs on computers. This has
	been going on for decades. Why do we have to manually set up
	include paths?  Why do we have to manually set up libraries for
	linking and define which libraries use which other libraries?
	What is the minimal amount of information required to build a program?
	<p/>
	In order for the programmer to set up us little as possible,
	modern systems should find this information automatically, and
	update the information if any files have changed.  There are
	some problems doing this for all programs, but for many programs,
	the constraints and tasks are not that difficult.
	<p/>
	We do not need yet another build system, but maybe some of these
	features will someday be incorporated into other tools.

    <h1>C++ Automated Build</h1>
    <h2>Include Paths</h2>
	Some of the difficulties with automatically finding include
	paths are described below.
	<ul>
	<li>C++ code is difficult to parse. This problem is pretty
	much solved by using a modern parser such as the CLang parser,
	and building some code around them to search for include paths.</li>
	<li>C++ macros can alter the files that are included. Two different
	include files can include a single include files with a different
	#define setting so that the included file has different include
	dependency results.
	Many projects do not have this problem at least for the header files
	that are defined within the project.  The future C++ module feature
	may be required to solve the macro problem for difficult projects.</li>
	<li>
	In C++, an include path	can be something like "&lt;gtk/gtk.h&gt;",
	which means that the include directory flag given to the compiler
	has to specify a directory one level higher in the directory tree.</li>
	<li>Many include files within a project could have the same name.</li>
	<li>Most projects rely on external project include paths, such
	as C++ standard libraries, or some other framework. At the moment these
	cannot be found automatically, at least not on all operating systems.
	</li>
	</ul>

    <h2>Setting up Build Tools</h2>
	It would also be nice if the build system automatically found the
	build tools. For example, it may search for g++ or for clang++. On
	Windows or Linux, it may search the "Path" environment variable, or on
	may search some standard directories.  In addition, some compiler
	options may be setup by default for debug and release versions.

    <h2>Specifying Source Code Grouping</h2>
	<p/>
	<embed src="../userguide/ExampleSourceTree.svg" type="image/svg+xml">
	<p/>
	For simple projects, it may be that all source code under a
	directory is used to build a single executable. For other projects,
	there can be many components of different types, such as static
	library, dynamic library or executable.  Each dynamic
	library or executable can use any static library.  At the moment,
	there is no way to automatically determine which source code in
	different directories are used to build a component. This must
	require some additional information from the programmer, but usually
	there should be no need to list all source or header files, or to
	specify the dependencies.

    <h2>Libraries</h2>
	In some operating systems, the linker may require the libraries to be
	listed in order.  This is not a big problem and is easily solved
	with available tools.

    <h2>External Packages</h2>
	In addition to external project include files, there are typically also
	external libraries required by projects.  These projects may also
	require additional compile or link time switches.  Under Linux, there
	can be quite a bit of information available, but under Windows, the
	task is a bit more difficult.


<h1>OovAide Build System</h1>
	An attempt was made to build an easy to use build system in the
	OovAide program.  This solution may not work for very large or
	complicated projects, but does work on projects that have multiple
	include paths, external packages, and builds multiple binary components.
	<p/>
	The following sections are defined roughly in the order that
	a programmer would go through to set up a project for building
	using the OovAide program.  Performing only analysis using OovAide
	only requires a subset of the steps defined here.
	<p/>
	OovAide allows specifying custom compile switches for the project.
	OovAide actually runs a command line build program called
	oovBuilder, which allows performing builds from the command line.
	OovAide also runs many of the build tasks in parallel by multitasking
	the processes.

    <h2>Specify Project Code Location</h2>
	The programmer must select a single source root directory for all of
	the source code that will be in the project.  It is possible to
	specify exclusion directories within the source root directory to
	specify directories that should not be analyzed or built.

    <h2>Setting Up Build Tools</h2>
	The OovAide program searches for the g++ and clang++ tools. It also
	requires the ar and nm tools for finding library dependencies.

    <h2>Setting up Build Configurations</h2>
	OovAide defines the standard Debug and Release configurations
	and sets up some default compiler switches for each configuration.
	The goal here is that external packages only need to be set
	once, and every configuration will use the common arguments.
	OovAide also supports adding more configurations for things such
	as cross compiling, but at the moment, a separate project may
	be required if the configurations are too different.
	<p/>
	Typically the external packages must be defined differently on Linux
	or Windows because the package systems are not the same on
	all systems.
	<p/>
	There is much room for improvement here.

    <h2>External Packages</h2>
	The advantage of having predefined external packages is that
	the programmer can select a single name such as MySQL or
	wxWidgets, and the appropriate compiler switches
	(with include paths), link switches, and link libraries can
	be used by a project. The OovAide program reads the package
	details and sends the appropriate information to the compiler or linker.
	<p/>
	On Linux, the pkgconfig program provides definitions for many
	popular packages. The pkgconfig program is on many Linux systems,
	and defines the compile and link information needed to use the
	package. The OovAide
	GUI provides a simple way to select external packages to add
	to the program.
	<p/>
	On Windows,
	a similar interface is provided for selecting libraries, but there is
	no common database that provides definitions of external libraries.
	A few library definitions are provided by OovAide, but others can be
	added by the programmer.  This is not a good long term solution, but
	there is not a common package manager on all systems yet.

    <h2>Directory Scan</h2>
	The OovAide program scans the directories under the source root
	directory to find all of the source and header files.
	<p/>
	At the moment, the directory scan is performed on the whole
	source root directory tree. This could be optimized in the
	future by performing directory monitoring, Scanning all directories
	may limit the use for very large projects.

    <h2>Specifying Source Code Grouping</h2>
	The following directory tree will be used to discuss some
	common scenarios.
	<p/>
	<embed src="../userguide/ExampleSourceTree.svg" type="image/svg+xml">
	<p/>
	An important point to remember is that the OovAide grouping mechanism
	is used for grouping source files into components. OovAide will set
	include paths for header files no matter where they are as long as
	the file names are unique.
	<p/>
	OovAide uses a simple method for defining components.  Any directory
	in the source root directory can be designated as a component.
	<p/>
	Some of the grouping rules:
	<ul>
    	<li>A component at any level of the tree will be built using all
	  source files in all subdirectories that are not defined as a
	  component. In this diagram, the top nodes ("Dir Root", "Dir A",
	  and "Dir B-2") are defined as components.</li>
	<li>The groupings do not determine where header files can be found.
	  They only determine which source files are compiled into the
	  component. Header files can be anywhere and will be automatically
	  found during analysis.</li>
	<li>Component "Dir A" could be a library, which will be linked into
	  other components automatically.</li>
	</ul>

    <h3>Example 1</h3>
	In the first example, "Dir Root" is defined as an executable component.
	Include files could be present in any directory, and these directories
	will be supplied to the compiler in order to build the object files
	from the source files.  All object files will be linked into the
	executable. 

    <h3>Example 2</h3>
	This example starts from the first example, and defines "Dir A" as
	a static library component.  This means that the programmer only has
	to select one item in the directory tree as a component, and
	OovAide will build a static library and link it into the executable
	without specifying and source paths, etc.  OovAide provides
	the StaticLib example that is similar to this.
	<a href="../userguide/examples.html">Examples</a>

    <h3>Example 3</h3>
	This example starts from the first example, and defines "Dir A" as
	a run-time library component.  This is not as nice as example 2,
	since the source code must be modified to define an interface
	and use the interface for the run-time bindings.

    <h3>Example 4</h3>
	A good example of a slightly more complex system is the OovAide
	project. It contains multiple executables (OovAide, OovBuilder,
	ClangView, OovCMaker, OovCovInstr, OovCppParser),
	multiple static libraries (OovCommon, and OovGuiCommon),
	a Java program (OovJavaParser), and a run-time library (OovDbWriter).
	There are include files in all of these component directories,
	and they are all properly built.

    <h2>Analysis</h2>
  	The CLang parser is run on all C++ files to generate include
	dependencies. The include dependencies are used to build object
	files, and to determine when they must be rebuilt when a source
	file changes.  The include dependencies are also used to determine
	which external packages are used by each component.
	<p/>
	A CRC is used on the command line switches to determine when
	the analysis and include dependencies must be updated. A separate
	directory is used for each CRC so that switching between settings
	is faster.
	<p/>
	While parsing the C++ files, include flags are set for all directories
	in the project that contain header files so that the CLang compiler
	can function correctly. In addition, OOvAide specifies the parent
	and grandparent directories so that relative paths such as &lt;gtk/gtk.h&gt;
	will compile. The number of include directories may be a problem on
	some versions of Windows for larger projects since the command line
	length may be limited to 32767 characters.
	<p/>
	It would be nice if CLang could request
	include flags dynamically during parsing to reduce possible problems
	that too many include directories could create.
	<p/>
	The CLang compiler is actually invoked twice. Once to generate
	include dependencies and analysis information, and then again
	to compile.  This can be a bit of a speed problem, but it is
	alleviated since OovAide performs multitasking for the build processes.
	It doesn't appear that CLang supports analyzing and building at
	the same time using the C-Index interface to the compiler.
	During the actual compile, only the include files that are
	required are specified as directories for faster compilation.
	<p/>
	At the moment, if the project is changed in a major manner,
	the conservative approach is taken, and all files are rebuilt.

    <h2>Build</h2>
	The build performs the directory scan to see what which files
	were modified. The file extensions are used to determine which
	tool to run on each file.  The nm tool is used to find the names
	in internal and external project libraries to determine library
	dependencies and link order.  Only files that are out of date are
	built.
	<p/>
	The include dependency directories are used to determine which
	external package libraries are needed to build a component that
	is linked.  OovAide does have constraints that the header file
	have to be unique in some cases in order to prevent linking the
	wrong library or finding the wrong include during a compile.  This
	is typically not a problem since most external packages have few
	files that are included directly in a project.
	<p/>
	At the moment, all project libraries are included in the link. This
	does not seem to cost much time since the unused libraries will be last
	during the link.  This rule may be changed in the future.
	<p/>

    <h1>Java Automated Build</h1>
	OovAide can also build very simple Java programs (generally a single jar)
	that are in the same directories along with C++ files.

    <h2>Directory Scan</h2>
	While the scan for C++ files is run under the source root
	directory, the java files are also found.

    <h2>Specifying Source Code Grouping</h2>
	The same directory setup is used as the C++ grouping.  The component
	types that are used for java are "Library Jar" or "Executable Jar".
	The difference is that a Manifest.txt file is required in any
	directory that is defined as an "Executable Jar". The manifest must
	have the Main-Class attribute set. See OovJavaParser directory
	as an example.

    <h2>Setting up Build Configurations</h2>
	The Java setup allows setting up the class path to allow
	references to external jars, and other arguments.

    <h2>Analysis and Build</h2>
	At the moment, the java parser is used to find the include dependencies.
	This may mean that the files must compile successfully in order for
	full analysis to be performed. The jar files are not built in any
	order at this time, so if one is dependent on another, sorry.
	A workaround is to define multiple OovAide projects, and to define
	exclude directories if needed.
	<p/>
	The correct way to fix this would be to have a pass that finds
	include dependencies before performing analysis or builds.  I am not
	sure if the Java parser supports this, but it appears that it might.
	In addition, the jar
	files have to be built in order which presents some interesting
	problems to solve in order to support multitasking.
