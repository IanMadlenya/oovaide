<h1>Oovcde C++ Code Coverage</h1>
Last Updated: Sept. 24, 2014
<br>

<h2>Test Coverage</h2>
The Oovcde project has some tools to support
 flow path test coverage analysis. It can show the
percentage of paths that have 
been tested in each source file and shows the number of times that
each instrumented line was executed. This can sometimes be used as a profiler and also to find dead code.
The CLang compiler is used to parse the source files.
<br><br>
The Oovcde program contains a build system that will work on C++ projects that
will cover many but not all project directory structures.  Even if the build system cannot
be used to build the project, it should be able to instrument many of the source files.
<br><br>



<h2>Code Instrumentation</h2>

The Oovcde project has a program named oovCovInstr that will read a source file

and produce an instrumented source file. The oovCovInstr is a command line utility that works
on an individual source file, and the Oovcde program provides a GUI that will run the utility
on all files in a project.
<br><br>
An example function in the source file
 is:<br>

<pre>
  void Location::setPosition(Location loc)
    {
    mX = loc.mX;
    mY = loc.mY;
    }
</pre>

The instrumented source file will look like:

<br>

<pre>  void Location::setPosition(Location loc)
    {
    COV_IN(COV_mary_cpp, 0);
    mX = loc.mX;
    mY = loc.mY;
    }
</pre>

The COV_IN line is a macro that simply increments an element in an array,
and the "COV_mary_cpp" is simply a #defined offset into the array. The array
will store the count of the number of times (hit count) that each instrumented
line has been run. The second argument is the index to an instrumented line in the
source file.

<br><br>

The COV_IN macro is intended to have a very low cost in execution time so
that 
it does not increase the running time too significantly.  The oovCovInstr
program will
 instrument any statements and compound statements, but will only
instrument a set of 
statements within a compound statement once for efficiency.
<br><br>

The macro is defined as the following.

<pre>
    #define COV_IN(fileIndex, instrIndex) gCoverage[fileIndex+instrIndex]++;
</pre>



An example of a simple statement in the code is the following.

<pre>  for(int i=0; i&lt;3; i++)<br>    mBags.push_back(WoolBag());<br></pre>

This code would be modified to include extra braces so that it could be
instrumented as follows:
<pre>
  for(int i=0; i&lt;3; i++)
    {
    COV_IN(COV_BlackSheep_cpp, 1)
    mBags.push_back(WoolBag());
    }
</pre>

The oovCovInstr program will also create a header (OovCoverage.h) and source
file (OovCoverage.cpp) that can
 be compiled into the final executable that
will be tested. The header file contains the macro and defines for the array offsets.
<br><br>

The source file contains code that will save the array into a file.  If there
is already an existing file, the code will first read the file, modify the
counts, and write to the file.  This allows multiple runs of the program to
append the counts from the multiple runs. The default name of the file is
"OovCoverageCounts.h".
The default configuration is that the array is saved when the program exits.<br><br>


<h2>Modifying and Building the Program Under Test</h2>

There are many ways that a program may be modified:
<ul>
<li>The hit count array may be saved at different times while the program is
running.</li>
<li>The hit counts could be made a different type to hold higher counts.</li>
<li>The hit count array file could be saved to a different location.</li>
</ul>
The Oovcde program provides a build system that will automatically create a
new project, and add the OovCoverage files as a library to the link for
the project.
<br><br>

<h2>Generating Statistics</h2>
The Oovcde program provides a menu to run the program that generates
statistics. This program reads the OovCoverage.h file to get the offsets
of the instrumented lines for each source file, and reads the hit counts
file (OovCoverageCounts.h) to get the number of times that each
instrumented line was executed.
<br><br>
The statistics are created in the project and named "oovCovStats.txt".
The file contains the names of the source files, along with the
percentage of instrumented lines that were executed in each file.
A simple example for two source files is the following.
<pre>    mary.cpp 100<br>    mary.h 100<br></pre>
This indicates that 100% of the paths in both files were executed.
<br><br>
Another form of output is that each instrumented file is marked with
a comment indicating the number of counts that a particular line was run.
The following shows that the instrumented line was run 3 times.
<pre>
  void Location::setPosition(Location loc)
    {
    COV_IN(COV_mary_cpp, 0);    // 3
    mX = loc.mX;
    mY = loc.mY;
    }
</pre>
To find lines that were never executed, simply search for "//&lt;space&gt;0".
<br><br>

<h2>Using with Externally Built or Run Systems</h2>
If the program to be tested cannot be built with Oovcde, or the program
must run on another system (Ex. embedded systems), then there are some
simple steps to generating statistics and hit count results.
<ul>
<li>First instrument the code as described above. Many times much of the
code will be instrumented even if not all compile errors can be removed.</li>
<li>Run the program on the target system.</li>
<li>Make sure there is an oov-cov-oovcde directory under the oovcde project
directory. Create an out-Debug directory under the oov-cov-oovcde directory.
Copy the OovCoverageCounts.txt file to the oov-cov-oovcde/out-Debug directory.</li>
<li>Run the Oovcde program and select the Coverage/Statistics menu item.</li>
</ul>


<h2>Using with Microsoft Code</h2>
The Analysis/Settings menu item in Oovcde can be used to set build
arguments.&nbsp; These are examples of some of the arguments that may be
needed for an older version of Visual Studio.<br>
<br>
<pre>
  -c
  -x c++
  -DWIN32_PC
  -DWIN32
  -D_WINDOWS
  -D_USRDLL
  -DUNICODE
  -D_WCHAR_T_DEFINED
  -D__int64=long long
  -D_M_IX86
