<h1>Background Task Queue</h1>

Last updated: March 10, 2015<br>

The Oovaide project has many types of multitasking that must be performed that
are described in <a href="OovaideMultitasking.html">OovaideMultitasking</a>.
The queue described here copies from <a href="TaskWaitQueue.html">ThreadedWorkWaitQueue</a>.
<p/>
This queue provides a single thread for processing background queued items.
The following functions are available to the client:
<ul>
<li>addTask</li>
<li>stopAndWaitForCompletion</li>
<li>isQueueBusy</li>
</ul>
Each item is processed on the background thread from the processItem function.
For long running tasks, the function called from processItem can query the
continueProcessingItem function so that long running tasks can abort.
<p/>
There is a class in OovProcess.h named OovTaskStatusListener that can be called from
the processItem function.  This status can be buffered by the GUI so that the
BackgroundDialog class in Gui.h can display the status from the GUI idle processing.
