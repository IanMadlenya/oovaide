    <h1>Detecting Dead C++ Code</h1>
    Oovcde has both static (compile-time) and dynamic (run-time) dead code detection.

    <h2>Static Dead Code Detection</h2>
    Oovcde uses CLang to parse C++ files.  It finds all methods and functions,
    and determines with a call graph which functions are not called by another
    function.  It outputs a table of the number of times each method or function
    is called.  The table is viewable in a brower, and is also output as XML.
    <p/>
    Typical output looks like the following:
    <p/>
<pre>
    See the output directory for the text file output.
    The all usage count is the count of usage by all other methods. 
    <table border="1">
	<tr><th>Class Name</th><th>Attribute Name</th><th>Type</th><th>All Use Count</th></tr>
	<tr><td>AddPackageDialog</td><td>~AddPackageDialog</td><td>destr</td><td>0</td></tr>
	<tr><td>AddPackageDialog</td><td>AddPackageDialog</td><td>constr</td><td>0</td></tr>
	<tr><td>Editor</td><td>DebugStatusChanged</td><td>virt</td><td>0</td></tr>
	<tr><td>ModelData</td><td>getBaseType</td><td></td><td>6</td></tr>
    </table>
</pre>
    <p/>
    Some tool limitations are:
    <ul>
    <li>Implicit calls to constructors and destructors or assignment operators
	are shown as being unreferenced.</li>
    <li>It is not possible to find out which virtual function is called, so they
	are displayed as being unreferenced
        </li>
    <li>
    Multiple functions with the same name can exist in a project when they
    are used to build different components.  Only one of them is used as the
    definition of the function, and the other called functions from the
    duplicately named functions will show up as being unreferenced.
    The tool can handle methods with the same name as long as they have unique
    signatures or are in different namespaces.  
    </li>
    </ul>

    These issues only cause the problem that too many functions
    are listed as dead code, and therefore the tool is still useful
    for identifying true dead code.

    <h2>Unused Members Detection</h2>
    Members can be accessed within the class, from other classes or functions.
    They can also be accessed as a data member or to access a method of the
    data member.
    Typical output looks like the following:
    <p/>
<pre>
    See the output directory for the text file output.
    The class usage count is the count of the number of methods in the same
    class that refer to the attribute. 
    <table border="1">
	<tr><th>Class Name</th><th>Attribute Name</th><th>Class Use Count</th><th>All Use Count</th></tr>
	<tr><td>ComponentListItem</td><td>mPathName</td><td>1</td><td>2</td></tr>
	<tr><td>PortionNode</td><td>mNodeType</td><td>2</td><td>2</td></tr>
    </table>
</pre>
    <p/>
    Some limitations are:
    <ul>
    <li>Classes with the same name used in different components within
	the project may list as having unused members.</li>
    </li>
    </ul>

    <p/>
    The tool was run on the Oovcde project, and found many instances of dead
    code.  This was a bit of a surprise since the project is written by a
    single author and the project has only about 40K lines of code.

    <h2>Dynamic Dead Code Detection</h2>
    Oovcde has a code coverage tool that is also built using CLang.
    It requires extensive tests written for the target project in order
    to be able to identify which code is not used.  The description
    of the coverage tool is here. <a href="TestCoverage.html">TestCoverage.html</a>
