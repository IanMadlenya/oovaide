    <h1>Detecting Dead C++ Code</h1>
    Oovcde has both static (compile-time) and dynamic (run-time) dead code detection.

    <h2>Static Dead Code Detection</h2>
    Oovcde uses CLang to parse C++ files.  It finds all methods and functions,
    and determines with a call graph which functions are not called by another
    function.  It outputs a table of the number of times each method or function
    is called.  The table is viewable in a brower, and is also output as XML.
    <p/>
    One of the limitations of the tool is that it cannot determine which
    virtual functions are called, so these show up as having a call count of zero.
    <p/>
    The tool can handle methods with the same name as long as they have unique
    signatures or are in different namespaces.  But if there are multiple
    functions with the same name because they used for different components
    in a project, then only one of them is used as the definition of the function,
    and the other called functions from the duplicately named functions will
    show up as not being called.
    <p/>
    Both of these issues only cause the problem that too many functions
    are listed as dead code, and therefore the tool is still usefull
    for identifying true dead code.
    <p/>
    The tool was run on the Oovcde project, and found many instances of dead
    code.  This was a bit of a surprise since the project is written by a
    single author and the project has only about 40K lines of code.

    <h2>Dynamic Dead Code Detection</h2>
    Oovcde has a code coverage tool that is also built using CLang.
    It requires extensive tests written for the target project in order
    to be able to identify which code is not used.  The description
    of the coverage tool is here. <a href="TestCoverage.html">TestCoverage.html</a>
