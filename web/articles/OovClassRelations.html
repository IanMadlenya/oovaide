    <h1>OOV Class Relations</h1>
	Standard UML does not show all of the relations that can occur between
	classes.  Since they are not shown, it may be difficult to find
	all related classes.  There are also many important relation attributes
	that are not shown, that visually can used to quickly identify errors.
	<p/>

	For example, a class could be instantiated in a function or method
	of another class. Typically these relations could be shown as an
	association or dependency, but many times are not shown on typical
	UML diagrams.
	<p/>

	Another example is a method that takes an argument that is a reference
	to a class, and these also are not shown.
	<p/>

	In C++, there are other examples such as when a template is passed a
	class as an argument to create a bound element.  The bound element
	has a template binding association, but the associations to the template
	parameters are often not shown.

    <h1>OOV Symbols</h1>
	The OOV symbols are used to show some of these other relationships, and
	to show extra information about relationships.
	<p/>

    <h2>OOV Relation Symbols</h2>
	The function body replationship symbol is simply a circle.<br/>
	<i>The movie created by this junky studio is so bad that it is never
	distributed.  The movie is instantiated and destructed in the
	createJunkyMovie method, but never used in an interface.</i>
	<p/>
    	<embed src="ClassRelationImages/FunctionBody.svg" type="image/svg+xml"> <br>
	<p/>

	The function parameter replationship symbol is two different sized circles.
	The symbol represents the function body with an argument.<br/>
	<i>An actor may perform some method acting within a scene of a movie,
	but the actor does not own the movie. The movie is used as a parameter
	in the performInScene method.</i>
	<p/>
    	<embed src="ClassRelationImages/FunctionParam.svg" type="image/svg+xml"> <br>
	<p/>

	In UML diagrams, the relationship to a template is shown, but the
	relationship to a template argument is typically not shown.  There are no
	new Oov symbols to show this relationship since the template specification
	in the class name is clear.<br/>
	<i>The IdentityDisplayer template adds the displayIdentity function to
	the Universe::Star class.</i>
	<p/>
    	<embed src="ClassRelationImages/Template.svg" type="image/svg+xml"> <br>
	<p/>

	Typedefs are usually not shown in UML diagrams.  The meaning of a template
	is the same as inheritance with no new attributes or methods.<br/>
	<i>The Universe::DisplayStar is a new name for
	IdentityDisplayer&lt;Universe::Star&gt;</i>
	<p/>
    	<embed src="ClassRelationImages/Typedef.svg" type="image/svg+xml"> <br>
	<p/>

    <h2>OOV Relation Attribute Symbols</h2>
	An important relationship in C++ is the &quot;const&quot; relationship.
	This is shown as a V shape.<br/>
	<i>A movie star may watch a released movie, but does not modify the
	movie, but when a movie star is performing in a movie, they do modify
	the movie.</i>
	<p/>
    	<embed src="ClassRelationImages/Const.svg" type="image/svg+xml"> <br>

	<p/>
	Another important relationship is the visibility of members and
	inheritance.  This is shown as nested circles. Unfilled circles are
	public, filled are private, and partially filled are protected.<br/>
	<i>Released movies are public, bad movies are private, and future
	good movies are protected.</i>
