    <h1>Viewing a Class for Composition</h1>

	Sometimes a class grows too large, and needs to be refactored. In
	some cases, it can be difficult to determine what will result in a
	clean separation of multiple classes.
	<p/>
	The Oovcde program can parse C++ code and create diagrams automatically.
	The following shows an example of a class portion diagram in the
	Oovcde program, and shows the "Package" class.  The data members are
	shown in rectangles, and the member functions are shown in ellipses.
	The arrows show the direction of the dependency.
	<p/>

	<p/>
	Some notes about this example:
	<ul>
	<li>One of the constructors and the destructor are empty, and
	    could be deleted.</li>
	<li>The second constructor calls the constructor in an inherited class.</li>
	<li>The set link and get link functions reference the link arguments,
	    but don't reference the compile arguments.</li>
	<li>The load map and save map functions reference both the
	    compile and link arguments.</li>
	</ul>
    <h2>CppParser Example</h2>
	<p/>
	Now we move on to an example of a class that needs to be refactored.
	This class is used in the Oovcde .cpp parser.  It is not the cleanest
	class to analyze since it uses function pointers called by the 
	clang visitor functions, but since this class was the inspiration for the
	portion diagrams, it seems like a worthy example.
        <embed src="PortionImages/PortionParserOrig.svg" type="image/svg+xml">
	<p/>
	For this refactoring, it is useful to think about how functions can
	be rearranged based on the data members.
	<ul>
	<li>For example, the mModelData
	    member is only used by functions in the top half of the graph for
	    creation of classes and data types.</li>
	<li>Another example is that there looks	like a bit of statement code
	    related to the mStatements and mSwitchContexts members.</li>
	</ul>
	<p/>
	Another important aspect is to think about the lifetimes of the
	data members. The mOperation and mClassifier members are only used while
	parsing classes and operations.
    <h2>CppParser Example - Refactor Phase 1</h2>
	For the first refactoring, the model data was moved into a new class called
	ParserModelData.
	<p/>
        <embed src="PortionImages/PortionParserModelData.svg" type="image/svg+xml">
	<p/>
	The remaining CppParser class is:
	<p/>
        <embed src="PortionImages/PortionParserPhase1.svg" type="image/svg+xml">
	<p/>
	
	The improvements that resulted are:
	<ul>
	<li>The interface to the model data used to be pretty large. Now the
	    interface is only what the ParserModelData exposes.  A few new
	    methods were added  (setLineStats, addAssociation, addParsedModule),
	    which makes it easy to see what the interface to the model data is.</li>
	<li>150 lines of code were removed from the CppParser class into a separate file.
	</ul>

	At this point, there are some tradeoffs for refactoring further.  The most
	likely candidates are to move the following data members into a
	CppOperationParser class:
	<ul>
	<li>mOperation</li>
	<li>mSwitchContexts</li>
	<li>mStatementRecurseLevel</li>
	<li>mStatements</li>
	</ul>
	On the one hand, the CppParser class size would be reduced, and
	the operation parts would be separated, but on the other hand, leaving
	the CppParser class as is means it contains all parsing functionality.


    <h2>Other Notes</h2>
	Some other notes about portion diagrams:
	<ul>
	<li>An attribute only used once could mean it is not used.</li>
	<li>A method that doesn't use an attribute could be made static if
	it does not call other non-static methods.</li>
	<li>A group of attributes used by a group of methods could mean
	the class should be refactored into multiple classes.</li>
	</ul>
	Other notes about the Oovcde program:
	<ul>
	<li>The Oovcde "Member Usage" feature can be used to find classes with
	unused attributes.</li>
	<li>The Oovcde complexity or line count features can be used to find which classes
	could be refactored.</li>
	</ul>
