    <h1>Viewing a Class for Composition</h1>

	Sometimes a class grows too large, and needs to be refactored. In
	some cases, it can be difficult to determine what will result in a
	clean separation of multiple classes.
	<p/>
	The Oovcde program can display all of the data members and functions of
	a class and show how they are related.  The C++ code is parsed and
	the diagrams are created automatically.
	The following shows a class portion diagram in the Oovcde program, and
	shows an example "Package" class.  The data members are
	shown in rectangles, and the member functions are shown in ellipses.
	The arrows show the direction of the dependency.
	<p/>

	<p/>
	Some notes about this example:
	<ul>
	<li>The RootDirPackage class is a base class that is accessed by
	    setCompileInfo, one of the constructors and the setLinkInfo methods.</li>
	<li>One of the constructors and the destructor are empty, and
	    could be deleted.</li>
	<li>The set link and get link functions reference the link argument
	    data member,
	    but don't reference the compile argument data member.</li>
	<li>The load map and save map functions reference both the
	    compile and link argument daa members.</li>
	</ul>
	<p/>
	Run the following to view these diagrams.
	<ul>
	    <li>Download the Oovcde Windows or Linux binaries from Sourceforge or
		download the source from 
		    <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/oovcde/">SourceForge</a>
		    or <a href="https://github.com/animatedb/oovcde">GitHub</a></li>
	    <li>Extract the downloaded file to any location</li>
	    <li>Run the oovcde program from the bin directory</li>
	    <li>Run File/New Project from the menu and browse to a C++ project
		of your choice. To view the Oovcde source, run File/Open Project
		from the menu and browse to the	trunk/test directory and select
		the trunk-oovcde-... file for linux or windows and press the
		Open button</li>
	    <li>Wait for the analysis to complete.</li>
	    <li>Click on the Portion tab and select a class to display a
		portion diagram</li>
	</ul>
    <h2>CppParser Example</h2>
	<p/>
	Now we move on to an example of a class that needs to be refactored.
	This class is used in the Oovcde .cpp parser.  The Oovcde program
	shows that it is in the module with the highest number of lines in
	all of the Oovcde source code, although the complexity is not the highest.
	This class is not the cleanest
	class to analyze since it uses function pointers to global functions called
	by the clang visitor functions, but since this class was the inspiration
	for the portion diagrams, it seems like a worthy example.
	<p/>
        <embed src="PortionImages/PortionParserOrig.svg" type="image/svg+xml">
	<p/>
	For this refactoring, it is useful to think about how functions can
	be rearranged based on the data members.
	<ul>
	<li>For example, the mModelData member is only used by functions
	    in the top half of the graph for creation of classes and data
	    types.</li>
	<li>Another example is that there looks	like a bit of statement code
	    related to the mStatements and mSwitchContexts members.</li>
	</ul>
	<p/>
	An important aspect is to think about the lifetimes of the
	data members. The mOperation and mClassifier members are only used while
	parsing classes and operations.


    <h2>CppParser Example - Post Refactor</h2>
	For the first refactoring, the model data was moved into a new class called
	ParserModelData.
	<p/>
        <embed src="PortionImages/PortionParserModelData.svg" type="image/svg+xml">
	<p/>
	The portion diagram shows a bit more than a class diagram since a typical
	class diagram would only show the following.
	<p/>
        <embed src="PortionImages/PortionParserModelDataClass.svg" type="image/svg+xml">
	<p/>
	The remaining CppParser class is shown below.
	<p/>
        <embed src="PortionImages/PortionParserPhase1.svg" type="image/svg+xml">
	<p/>
	
	The improvements that resulted are:
	<ul>
	<li>The interface to the model data used to be pretty large. Now the
	    interface is only what the ParserModelData exposes.  A few new
	    methods were added  (setLineStats, addAssociation, addParsedModule),
	    which makes it easy to see what the interface to the model data is.</li>
	<li>150 lines of code were removed from the CppParser class into a separate file.
	</ul>

	At this point, there are some tradeoffs for refactoring further.  The most
	likely candidates are to move the following data members into a
	CppOperationParser class:
	<ul>
	<li>mOperation</li>
	<li>mSwitchContexts</li>
	<li>mStatementRecurseLevel</li>
	<li>mStatements</li>
	</ul>
	On the one hand, the CppParser class size would be reduced, and
	the operation parts would be separated, but on the other hand, leaving
	the CppParser class as is means it contains all parsing functionality.


    <h2>Other Notes</h2>
	Some other notes about portion diagrams:
	<ul>
	<li>An attribute only used once could mean it could be eliminated. A counter
	   example would be some data that is retained between calls.</li>
	<li>A method that doesn't use an attribute could be made static if
	it does not call other non-static methods and is not virtual.</li>
	</ul>
	Other notes about the Oovcde program:
	<ul>
	<li>The Oovcde "Member Usage" feature can be used to find classes with
	unused attributes.</li>
	<li>The Oovcde complexity or line count features can be used to find which classes
	could be refactored.</li>
	</ul>
