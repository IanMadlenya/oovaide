

New relations
------
	function parameters
	function variables

	templates:
	Parameterized class		- uses <<template>> stereotype
	Bound element (derived type)	- show dependency arrow (dashed line with arrow)

New relation attributes
-----
	visibility			- drawn close to inheritance or aggregation symbol
					  but so it doesn't conflict with func symbols
	const				- when multiple, any const or all must be const?

Combinations
------
	multiple instances can exist, but only a single class is drawn.
	inheritance, aggr and func symbols are all drawn if any exist
	func param is drawn if both func parm and var both exist

connection lines
----
	if template or other, draw solid


namespaces - full namespaces are always displayed

UML inheritance/aggregation symbols are shown at inconsitent ends
