      Help</h1>
    Oovaide can analyze projects, and can also build projects. The setup for
    analysis is simpler than the setup for building projects since only compile
    type parsing is performed, and the building of library and run-time
    components does not need to be specified.

    <h2><a class="mozTocH2" id="mozTocId929749"></a>Oovaide Analysis</h2>
    One goal of Oovaide is to be able to analyze a project by only providing a
    simple setup for analysis. This allows analyzing projects where nothing is
    known about the source code.
    <p> When a new project is created the following can be defined. </p>
    <ul>
      <li>A single parent directory can be provided to specify the location of
        the source code of the project to be analyzed.</li>
      <li>A directory called the OovAide project directory is specified that
        contains all of the analysis information that is gathered about the
        source directory.</li>
      <li>Optionally some exclude directories can be set up for the project to
        prevent using some directories from being used as include directories,
        and to prevent source files from being analyzed.</li>
    </ul>
    After a project is created, these directories can be viewed using the
    Analysis/Project Settings menu item. The source root directory can be
    changed if the directory does not exist.
    <p> Oovaide scans the directories of the project under the source root
      directory to find source files that need to be analyzed. The extensions of
      the files in the directories are used to determine which source file
      parser to use. Oovaide can analyze and build a single directory tree that
      contains both C++ and Java files. In fact, Oovaide itself can be built
      this way. </p>
    <h2><a class="mozTocH2" id="mozTocId694741"></a>C++ Analysis</h2>
    There are typically three types of files used to analyze or build a project.
    <ul>
      <li> <b>Project Files</b> - Files that are defined by the project. These
        are specified by the source root directory. Detailed analysis
        information is only gathered for these types of files.</li>
      <li><b>Compiler Libraries</b> - Files that are part of the standard
        library. These are typically supplied by the compiler and normally these
        do not need to be specified for analysis. Some examples of these files
        limits.h, stdio.h, or files from STL.</li>
      <li><b>External Packages</b> - Files that are defined that are needed by
        the project, but are defined external to the project. The easiest way to
        specify externally required files is to use the "External Project
        Packages" button. Some examples of these packages are GTK, Boost, etc.</li>
    </ul>
    <p> Oovaide scans all directories in the project, and adds include directory
      paths to the compiler command line for any directories in the project that
      contain header files. </p>
    <p> OovAide uses the CLang parser for analysis. This means that problems
      with include paths can be solved by searching the web for typical CLang
      installation problems. </p>
    <p> Oovaide generally uses one set of compiler settings for all directories.
      This typically means that a superset of all packages must be specified.
      For example, if gtk is not needed for some directories, adding it for all
      directories should not cause a problem for directories that do not require
      gtk. It may make analysis slower, but should not fail. </p>
    <p> Each header and source file is analyzed independently. This means that
      each file should be able to include all definitions needed. Search the web
      for "self-sufficient headers", or "self-contained headers", for more
      information. On many projects, a fairly small include change can be made
      to the source to be able to analyze much of the source. </p>
    <p> Not all compiler errors need to be fixed to generate useful diagrams.
      Oovaide will still generate references to undefined objects as long as the
      compiler has parsed beyond the initial errors. If the files do not include
      all needed definitions (they expect the source that includes them to
      include other files first), then the error limit may need to be increased
      so that more of the file can be parsed. The other alternative is to fix
      the header files so that they include the needed definitions. </p>
    <p> In Linux, the CLang compiler is not shipped with Oovaide, but must be
      present on the system. </p>
    <h3><a class="mozTocH3" id="mozTocId634053"></a>Choosing External C++
      Packages</h3>
    Packages are collections of include and library files that are distributed
    for use by many programs. Some examples are GTK, Qt, etc. Oovaide provides
    an "External Project Packages" button on the C++ Settings screen that allows
    selecting packages.
    <p> Packages are different on Windows and Linux. On Linux, the pkg-config
      tool is used by the Oovaide package dialogs so that packages can be
      selected and used in each project. </p>
    <p> On Windows, there is a file called bin/oovaide-allpkgs-win.txt, that
      defines a few common packages. This file can be easily read to see how
      packages are defined, and it is possible to modify and add more packages.
    </p>
    <p> On Windows, Oovaide attempts to find directories using wildcards in the
      package directory definitions. If there are multiple versions, then the
      directory can be specified manually. </p>
    <p> If the "Include Directory" setting is blank, then the directories are
      scanned for include files, and paths are saved. To prevent this scan,
      directories can be specified (separated with semicolons) or a single
      period can be used to specify that only the current directory relative to
      the root should be used as the path. </p>
    <h3><a class="mozTocH3" id="mozTocId18425"></a>Oovaide C++ Settings</h3>
    The CLang compiler arguments for Analysis are set up in the
    Analysis/Settings dialog in the C++ Settings tab. Many arguments are passed
    directly to the compiler, so for example, "-I/dir" will use "/dir" as an
    include path to search. There are a few special arguments that Oovaide uses
    as described below.
    <p> The argument order is important if there are files with the same names
      in different directories. </p>
    <p> </p>

    <h3><a class="mozTocH3" id="mozTocId966297"></a>Solving C++ Analysis /
      Compile Problems</h3>
    One of the most difficult problems can be solving include path problems. The
    include directories for files in the project do not have to be set since
    OovAide sets these automatically. OovAide requires that the include file
    names are unique, or the wrong one could be used.
    <p> See the Inkscape Example below for more problem solving information. </p>
    <p> </p>
    <h4><a class="mozTocH4" id="mozTocId416185"></a>LibCLang missing</h4>
    OovAide requires the C interface to the CLang library. On Windows, the CLang
    library is supplied with OovAide.
    <p> On Linux, the library is not supplied. If the library does not exist, an
      error like the following will occur. "error while loading shared
      libraries: libclang-3.6.so.1: cannot open shared object file". A package
      manager will allow adding the CLang package that is required. In Debian
      systems such as Ubuntu, the Synaptic Package Manager can be used to find
      the package by searching for "clang interface", and it may be named
      something like libclang1-3.6. </p>
    <h4><a class="mozTocH4" id="mozTocId948534"></a>Analyzing projects (such as
      OovAide) that use CLang libraries</h4>
    If an error displays "fatal error: clang-c/Index.h: No such file or
    directory", then something like libclang-3.6-dev is needed. OovAide should
    work with many versions of the libclang library.

    <h4><a class="mozTocH4" id="mozTocId919305"></a>Missing Standard Library
      Includes</h4>
    On Linux, OovAide attempts to define some standard include paths for
    analysis using -isystem when a project is created.  If these are not correct,
    it may be required to set them manually after the project as been created.
    <p/>
    If an error appears such as "error: 'stdio.h' file not found" or for 
    'limits.h' or 'stddef.h', this means that CLang is not finding the include
    files in some standard locations. It is possible to find the locations that
    CLang is looking by using the -v switch in the Analysis/Settings menu on the
    C++ Settings tab in the Common Build Arguments edit box.
    On Debian, the package that includes the files is libclang-common-x.x-dev,
    which is included by using libclang-x.x-dev.  Sometimes using the 
    build-essentials may help.
    <p/>
    It is possible to find the intersection of files that packages supply,
    and where clang is searching using the following.
    Using "echo '#include <stddef.h>' | clang -xc -v -", showed that clang
    was searching for /usr/lib/llvm-3.6/bin/../lib/clang/3.6.2/include. Remember
    that the paths during analysis and build are different since the path
    to oovCppParser is different than the path to clang.
    Using "dpkg --search stddef.h", showed that
    libclang-common-3.6-dev supplied the file
    /usr/lib/llvm-3.6/lib/clang/3.6.2/include/stddef.h.  The "-xc -v -"
    switches can also be used in the OovAide analysis settings.

    <h4><a class="mozTocH4" id="mozTocId597034"></a>Builtin identifiers</h4>
    If an error "undeclared identifier __builtin__ia32_bsri" displays, this
    means that the clang headers are not found or the libclang.dll version is
    does not match and is not searching the paths the same. For example, CLang
    versions 3.6 and 3.7 are in different locations at least on Windows. In
    Windows, depends.exe will show the locations. On Linux, the ldd program can
    be used to show dependencies for oovCppParser.
    <h4><a class="mozTocH4" id="mozTocId98516"></a>CLang headers</h4>
    The CLang headers should not be analyzed or else the "Never use
    &lt;adxintrin.h&gt; directly" error will display.
    <h2><a class="mozTocH2" id="mozTocId485883"></a>Java Analysis</h2>
    The oovJavaParser.jar tool that is distributed with OovAide is used to parse
    and analyze the java source files. A single java file is analyzed at a time.
    <p> The Analysis/Settings menu selection will display a tab named "Java
      Settings". This tab allows setting the class path and JDK path. </p>
    <p> The class path is initialized from the CLASSPATH environment variable,
      but altering it in the settings will not change the CLASSPATH environment
      variable. The class path must contain all jars that are needed for your
      project. The CLASSPATH environment variable does not need to include
      tools.jar since it is added from the JDK path as described below. </p>
    <p> The JDK path is initialized from the JAVA_HOME environment variable, but
      altering it in the settings will not change the JAVA_HOME environment
      variable. In Linux, if JAVA_HOME is missing, then
      "/usr/lib/jvm/default-java" is used as default. The JDK path must be set
      to the JAVA SDK. An example is: "C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.8.0_51". This
      path is used to find the tools.jar file in the lib directory. </p>
    <p> The Extra Analyze Arguments can be used to set switches, or to add java
      files that will be added to the analysis. </p>
    <h3><a class="mozTocH3" id="mozTocId619101"></a>Android Analysis</h3>
    In Android with Windows, the class paths may contain something similar to
    the following:
    <ul>
      <li>...\AppData\Local\Android\sdk\platforms\android-22\android.jar</li>
      <li>...\AppData\Local\Android\sdk\extras\android\support\v7\appcompat\libs\android-support-v7-appcompat.jar</li>
      <li>...\AppData\Local\Android\sdk\extras\android\support\v4\android-support-v4.jar</li>
    </ul>
    The Extra Analyze Arguments may contain something similar to the following:
    <ul>
      <li>
...\AndroidStudioProjects\MyApplication\app\build\generated\source\r\debug\com\example\blahad01\myapplication\R.java</li>
    </ul>
    <p> </p>
    <h3><a class="mozTocH3" id="mozTocId805501"></a>Solving Java Analysis
      Problems</h3>
    If an error displays "java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError:
    com/sun/source/tree/Tree", this means that the JDK tools path must be set.
    The package that is required in Ubuntu is something like openjdk-7-jdk and
    can be found in the Synaptic Package Manager. Once the package is installed,
    the Properties/Install Files tab shows the installation location of
    tools.jar at something like /usr/lib/jvm/openjdk-i386/lib/tools.jar, so the
    JDK path must be set to /usr/lib/jvm/openjdk-i386 in the Analysis/Settings
    menu on the Java Settings tab.
    <h2><a class="mozTocH2" id="mozTocId485848"></a>OovAide Build</h2>
    If analysis has completed successfully, then building applications with
    multiple libraries and executables is fairly easy.
    <p> The Build Settings dialog under the Build menu allows selecting a
      directory and specifying what type of component to build from the
      directory. For example, if a single executable will be built from the
      whole directory tree, then select the <root> component/directory, and
        define it as a Program/Executable (for C++) or as a Java Executable Jar
        (for Java). </root></p>
    <p> The following directory structure shows how components can be created.
      See the user guide for more information. </p>
    <p> <embed src="../userguide/ExampleSourceTree.svg" type="image/svg+xml"> </p>
    <p> Some of the rules are: </p>
    <ul>
      <li>A component at any level of the tree will be built using all source
        files in all subdirectories that are not defined as a component. In this
        diagram, the top nodes ("Dir Root", "Dir A", and "Dir B-2") are defined
        as components.</li>
      <li>The groupings do not determine where header files can be found. They
        only determine which source files are compiled into the component.
        Header files can be anywhere and will be automatically found during
        analysis.</li>
      <li>Component "Dir A" could be a library, which will be linked into other
        components automatically.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3><a class="mozTocH2 mozTocH3" id="mozTocId332885"></a>OovAide Build C++</h3>
    Use the Build/Build Settings menu to specify component types. The Extra
    Build Arguments on this screen are specific to each component.
    <h3><a class="mozTocH2 mozTocH3" id="mozTocId671330"></a>OovAide Build Java</h3>
    Any component specified as a Java Executable Jar must have a Manifest.txt
    file in the component's source directory.
    <p> The classpath must include all jars that are required for the build. The
      Java Library Jar can be used to build a jar that is not a stand-alone
      executable. At the moment, Oovaide does not determine jar dependency build
      order, so if this is a problem, multiple projects may have to be created
      to work around this for now. </p>
    <p> The package names must match the directory structure. For each jar that
      is created, the package names in the java files must match the directories
      under the specified component's directory. </p>
    <p> The Extra Build Arguments can be used to specify switches or to add jar,
      java or class files. </p>
    <h2><a class="mozTocH3 mozTocH2" id="mozTocId513853"></a>Inkscape Example on
      Windows</h2>
    This example shows how to analyze a project where little is known about the
    project. This example was run on Windows, but some items will be similar on
    Linux.
    <p> For this example, we will attempt to analyze the Inkscape program. The
      Inkscape program requires gtkmm and boost, so they need to be added as
      external packages. Since gtkmm includes mingw, there is no reason to
      additionally add a separate mingw package. </p>
    <p> I don't know which version of gtkmm is needed, so I just downloaded the
      Tarnyko gtkmm-3.4.0_mingw-4.6.2 version. Use Oovaide to add gtkmm as an
      external package. </p>
    <p> At first, there was a compile error about a missing config.h. I never
      ran the configure command, so I cheated and copied config.h.in to config.h
      in the Inkscape source code. </p>
    <p> The following problem is displayed during analysis, and resolved by
      adding an include of "gtkmm-3.0/gtkmm.h" to the Inkscape source in
      src/extension/param/parameter.h. The real problem is that Inkscape does
      not define all classes before they are referenced in header files. </p>
    <pre>	C:/Dave/Mine/software/external-projects/inkscape-0.91/inkscape-0.91/src/
	  extension/param/parameter.h:42:8: error: use of undeclared identifier 'Glib'
	</pre>
    Similar to the first problem, more includes need to be added, so add the
    following includes to the parameter.h file before the gtkmm include.
    #include "xml/node.h", #include "extension/extension.h".
    <pre>	C:/Dave/Mine/software/external-projects/inkscape-0.91/inkscape-0.91/src/
	  extension/param\string.h:17:28: error: expected class name
	C:/Dave/Mine/software/external-projects/inkscape-0.91/inkscape-0.91/src/
	  extension/param\string.h:27:86: error: use of undeclared identifier 'Parameter'
	</pre>
    Inkscape defines float.h which conflicts with the external mingw library
    float.h. This problem can be eliminated by selecting "Analysis/Project
    Settings", and adding "inkscape-0.91/src/extension/param/" to Exclude
    Sub-Directories.
    <pre>	C:/Dave/Mine/software/external-projects/inkscape-0.91/inkscape-0.91/src/
	extension/param\float.h:32:23: error: unknown type name 'gchar'
	</pre>
    The CLang compiler requires intrinsics from its own header file, and cannot
    use the one from mingw. The CLang compiler searches some paths which can be
    seen by adding the -v switch to the compiler options. The first files that
    CLang is searching for are shipped in the CLang package under the LLVM/lib
    directory. These must be found before the mingw directories. The best option
    is NOT to add the mingw directories to a project, since CLang will normally
    find them. Another option may be to use "-Iclang/3.6.0/include" before the
    other external package ref arguments ("-EP").
    <pre>	/gtkmm340_mingw462/lib/gcc/mingw32/4.6.2/include\ia32intrin.h:41:10:
	error: use of undeclared identifier '__builtin_ia32_bsrsi'
	</pre>
    Inscape requires the Boehm garbage collector. This can be added by defining
    a new external package, or by using -I with the "include" directory
    specified. The sigc++ library can be added in the same manner with the
    "sigc++" directory specified. These packages are probably not needed to get
    a pretty good analysis of Inkscape.
