<h1>Oovaide Build Help</h1>

<h2>Overview of Oovaide Analysis Process</h2>
  One goal of Oovaide is to be able to analyze a project by only providing
  a simple setup for analysis.  This allows analyzing projects where
  nothing is known about the source code.
  <p/>
  Oovaide scans the directories of the project under the source root directory
  and adds include paths for any directories that contain header files.
  Exclude directories can be set up for the project if needed.
  <p/>
  Oovaide generally uses one set of compiler settings for all directories. This
  typically means that a superset of all packages must be specified.  For example,
  if gtk is not needed for some directories, adding it for all directories should
  not cause a problem for directories that do not require gtk.  It may make
  analysis slower, but should not fail.
  <p/>
  Each header and source file is analyzed independently. This means
  that each file should be able to include all definitions needed.
  If the files do not include all needed definitions (they expect the
  source that includes them to include other files first), then the
  error limit may need to be increased so that more of the
  file can be parsed.  The other alternative is to fix the header files
  so that they include the needed definitions.
  <p/>
  Not all compiler errors need to be fixed to generate useful diagrams.
  Oovaide will still generate references to undefined objects as long as
  the compiler has parsed beyond the initial errors.

<h2>Packages</h2>
  Packages are collections of include and library files that are distributed
  for use by many programs.  Some examples are gtk, Qt, etc.  Oovaide
  provides an "External Project Packages" button on the build arguments
  screen that allows selecting packages.
  <p/>
  Packages are different on Windows and Linux.  On Linux, the pkg-config tool
  is used by the Oovaide package dialogs so that packages can be selected
  and used in each project.

<h2>Windows Packages</h2>
  On Windows, there is a file called
  bin/oovaide-allpkgs-win.txt, that defines a few common packages.  This file
  can be easily read to see how packages are defined, and it
  is possible to modify and add more packages.
  <p/>
  On Windows, Oovaide attempts to find directories using wildcards in the
  package directory definitions.  If there are multiple versions, then
  the directory can be specified manually.
  <p/>
  If the "Include Directory" setting is blank, then the directories are
  scanned for include files, and paths are saved.  To prevent this scan,
  directories can be specified (separated with semicolons) or a single
  period can be used to specify that only the current directory relative
  to the root should be used as the path.
  <p/>
  The "External References" can be specified with exclude directories
  the same as in the Build Arguments.
  

<h2>Oovaide Build Arguments</h2>
The CLang compiler arguments for Analysis are set up in the Analysis/Settings
dialog in the Build Arguments tab.  Many arguments are passed directly to the
compiler, so for example, "-I/dir" will use "/dir" as an include path to
search.  There are a few special arguments that Oovaide uses as described below.
<p/>
The argument order is important if there are files with the same names in different
directories.
<p/>
<table border="1">
	<tr>
	<th>Flag</th><th>Name</th><th>Description</th>
	</tr>
	<tr>
	<td>-EP</td><td>External Packages</td>
	<td>
	This flag should be added using the "External Project Packages" button.
	This specifies the name of the package to use for the OovBuilder.
	</td></tr>

	<tr><td>-ER</td><td>External Recursive Directories</td>
	<td>
	This flag allows specifying a root directory to search for includes
	and libraries.  It also allows specifying exclude directories. An
	example is "/rootdir/!/test/!/examples/", so that any filepath that
	matches test or examples will be excluded.
	</td></tr>

	<tr><td>-lnk</td><td>Link Flag</td>
	<td>The value following this flag is sent to the linker.
	Some examples are "-lnk-L/libdir", or "-lnk../dir/objfile.o".
	</td></tr>
</table>

<h2>Problem Solving</h2>
  Oovaide should delete all stale configuration files whenever the build
  settings are modified.  In the case that it does not, it is possible to
  delete the following:
  <ul>
	<li>oovaide-pkg.txt - keeps project package information</li>
	<li>oovaide=tmp-* - keeps directory scanned project information</li>
	<li>analysis directories - keeps object diagram information</li>
  </ul>
  An analysis directory is created for each set of build arguments.
  <p/>
   See the Inkscape Example for more problem solving information.


<h2>Inkscape Example on Windows</h2>
  This example shows how to analyze a project where little is known about
  the project.  This example was run on Windows, but some items will
  be similar on Linux.
  <p/>
  For this example, we will attempt to analyze the Inkscape program.  The
  Inkscape program requires gtkmm and boost, so they need to be added as
  external packages.  Since gtkmm includes mingw, there is no reason to
  additionally add a separate mingw package.
  <p/>
	I don't know which version of gtkmm is
	needed, so I just downloaded the Tarnyko gtkmm-3.4.0_mingw-4.6.2 version.
	Use Oovaide to add gtkmm as an external package.
	<p/>
	At first, there was a compile error about a missing config.h.  I never
	ran the configure command, so I cheated and copied config.h.in to config.h
	in the Inkscape source code.
	<p/>
	The following problem
	is displayed during analysis, and resolved by adding an include of
	"gtkmm-3.0/gtkmm.h" to the Inkscape source in
	src/extension/param/parameter.h. The real problem is that Inkscape does
	not define all classes before they are referenced in header files. 
	<pre>
	C:/Dave/Mine/software/external-projects/inkscape-0.91/inkscape-0.91/src/
	  extension/param/parameter.h:42:8: error: use of undeclared identifier 'Glib'
	</pre>
	Similar to the first problem, more includes need to be added, so
	add the following includes to the parameter.h file before
	the gtkmm include. #include "xml/node.h", #include "extension/extension.h".
	<pre>
	C:/Dave/Mine/software/external-projects/inkscape-0.91/inkscape-0.91/src/
	  extension/param\string.h:17:28: error: expected class name
	C:/Dave/Mine/software/external-projects/inkscape-0.91/inkscape-0.91/src/
	  extension/param\string.h:27:86: error: use of undeclared identifier 'Parameter'
	</pre>

	Inkscape defines float.h which conflicts with the external mingw library float.h.
	This problem can be eliminated by selecting "Analysis/Project Settings", and
	adding "inkscape-0.91/src/extension/param/" to Exclude Sub-Directories.
	<pre>
	C:/Dave/Mine/software/external-projects/inkscape-0.91/inkscape-0.91/src/
	extension/param\float.h:32:23: error: unknown type name 'gchar'
	</pre>

	The CLang compiler requires intrinsics from its own header file,
	and cannot use the one from mingw. The CLang compiler searches some paths
	which can be seen by adding the -v switch to the compiler options.
	The first files that CLang is searching for are shipped in the CLang package under
	the LLVM/lib directory.  These must be found before the mingw directories.
	The best option is NOT to add the mingw directories to a project, since CLang
	will normally find them.
	Another option may be to use "-Iclang/3.6.0/include" before the other
	external package ref arguments ("-EP").
	<pre>
	/gtkmm340_mingw462/lib/gcc/mingw32/4.6.2/include\ia32intrin.h:41:10:
	error: use of undeclared identifier '__builtin_ia32_bsrsi'
	</pre>

	Inscape requires the Boehm garbage collector.  This can be added by
	defining a new external package, or by using -I with the "include" directory
	specified.  The sigc++ library can be added in the same manner with the "sigc++"
	directory specified. These
	packages are probably not needed to get a pretty good analysis of Inkscape.
	<pre>
	C:/Dave/Mine/software/external-projects/inkscape-0.91/inkscape-0.91/src/
	  gc-core.h:25:11: fatal error: 'gc.h' file not found
	</pre>
	To summarize, by modifying two source files, and creating a simple Oovaide
	project, it was fairly easy to perform analysis on the Inkscape project.
