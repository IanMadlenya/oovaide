    To work with the examples, see <a href="examples.html">examples</a>.<br>
    <br>
    <ol>
      <li>Use File/New and create a new Oovcde project using an existing or new
        C++ project. There are example source projects in trunk/examples.<br>
      </li>
      <ol>
        <li>select a new directory for source files, or an existing directory
          that is the root directory of existing source files.</li>
        <li>select an output project directory to store oov project files.</li>
      </ol>
      <li>OR: Use File/Open and open the trunk/test/trunk-oovcde-win or
        trunk/test/trunk-oovcde-linux directory.<br>
      </li>
      <li>At this point, it may be possible to view diagrams if the include
        paths are set. They are already set if the oovcde project was opened.
        Select Analysis/Settings and select the Cpp Arguments tab to change the
        include paths and compile and link settings. Note that the include and
        library paths can both be set using the External Project Packages
        button, or recursive searches using "-ER". See below for more
        information.<br>
      </li>
      <li>Build a project. These steps are not required for viewing diagrams.
        Building Oovcde requires CLang and GTK to be downloaded and to match the
        paths in the Analysis/Settings/Cpp Arguments settings.<br>
      </li>
      <ol>
        <li>Select Build/Settings and set the component type for each component.
          For the Oovcde project, the oovCommon and oovGuiCommon components are
          static libraries, and all other oov... components are executables.<br>
        </li>
        <li>Select Build/Build Debug to build a debug version of the project.<br>

    <p>The Oovcde program performs many types of analysis on a selected set of
      source code.&nbsp; Setting up a new project requires selecting the root
      directory that contains the source code.&nbsp; Then Oovcde scans the
      directories for include and source files.&nbsp; There are many types of
      diagrams to allow viewing different levels of code.</p>

    <h2><a class="mozTocH3 mozTocH2" name="mozTocId728139"></a>Setting Up
      Analysis Projects</h2>
    Anlyzing projects allows viewing zone, class and sequence diagrams. It is
    also the first step towards building projects and running code coverage.<br>
    <br>
    <ol>
      <li>Start the "oovcde" program</li>
      <li>Use File/New to create a new project</li>
      <li>The Project Settings dialog will appear that allows choosing the
        source root of the source files to analyze. The location can be
        specified for saving all of the project files for Oovcde. Files can be
        excluded from analysis. This can also be changed later.</li>
      <li>Select the Analysis/Settings menu item. Choose the "Cpp Arguments" tab
        to change the include paths and other compiler settings. Errors during
        compilation are stored in the project directory. If there are errors,
        change the compiler settings and restart analysis.See the Build section
        for more examples.</li>
    </ol>
    To open a previously saved project, select File/Open and specify the
    previously saved Oovcde project directory.

    <h2><a class="mozTocH2" name="mozTocId407903"></a>Component Diagrams</h2>
    Component diagrams are similar to UML (Unified Modelling Language) component
    diagrams. A component diagram displays components such as static or shared
    libraries and executables. When the Comp tab is clicked, the component
    diagram for a project is generated automatically.<br>
    <br>
    Any component that has the Component Type defined in the Build Settings
    dialog will be displayed. In addition, the components that are defined in
    the Analysis/Settings Build Arguments dialog using the External Project
    Packages will be displayed. The analysis will figure out the dependencies
    and the dependency arrows will also be generated automatically.<br>
    <ol>
      <li>The components for a project are displayed in the left pane in the
        "Comp" tab. The components list is a list of the source files for the
        project.</li>
      <li>After the Component Types have been specified in the Build/Settings
        dialog, and the analysis has been run, then clicking on any component in
        the components list will update the diagram and show the dependencies
        between the run-time components.</li>
      <li>The components can be moved by clicking and dragging the components.</li>
      <li>Right clicking on a component allows:</li>
      <ol>
        <li>Remove Component - Removes the component from the diagram</li>
        <li>Show Implicit Relations - Shows relations between all components</li>
        <li>Relayout - Repositions the components</li>
        <li>Restart - Adds all removed components.<br>
        </li>
      </ol>
    </ol>
    <h2><a class="mozTocH2" name="mozTocId280779"></a>Zone Diagrams</h2>
    A zone diagram displays all classes in the project in a circle diagram where
    all classes are layed out on the circumference of the circle.&nbsp; Any two
    classes that are related will have a line drawn between them.<br>
    <ol>
      <li>The zone diagram component (directory) list/tree allows selecting
        which components are displayed on the diagram.</li>
      <li>Right clicking on the component list allows:</li>
      <ol>
        <li>Hide All, Show All - Hiding or showing all components</li>
        <li>Hide Children, Show Children - Hiding or showing all components that
          are children of the selected component</li>
        <li>Map Path - This allows combining directories into a single directory
          for the graph. For example, mapping /usr/include to /inc-lib and
          /usr/lib to /inc-lib, will combine both directories into one component
          in the graph. Child components with unique names are listed
          separately.<br>
        </li>
      </ol>
      <li>Right clicking on the graph allows:</li>
      <ol>
        <li>Go To Class - Displays the class diagram for the selected class</li>
        <li>View Source - Displays the source code for the selected class</li>
        <li>Show All Classes - Showing all classes or just showing components</li>
        <li>Show Function Relations - Shows classes as related if a class has a
          member function that uses another class.</li>
        <li>Show Dependencies - Displays an arrow at the end of a relationship.
          The arrow end is the end that is the supplier and the non-arrow end is
          the consumer.</li>
        <li>Zoom In/Out - Zoom the diagram</li>
      </ol>

    <h2><a class="mozTocH3 mozTocH2" name="mozTocId269360"></a>Class Diagrams</h2>
    Class diagrams are similar to UML (Unified Modelling Language) class
    diagrams. They display the members of the classes and relations between
    classes.<br>
    <br>
    <ol>
      <li>The classes for a project are displayed in the left pane in the Class
        tab. Left click on a class to display a diagram of related classes with
        standard relations. Right click adds the selected class with standard
        relations.<br>
      </li>
      <li>Right clicking on a class will display a popup menu that allows adding
        classes with various types of relationships.</li>
      <li>Left click on a class and drag the cursor to the desired location to
        move a class.</li>
    </ol>
    Right clicking on a class also allows
    <ul>
      <li>Go To Class - Shows the class diagram for the selected class</li>
      <li>View Source - Views the source code</li>
      <li>Add Standard Relations - Adds classes that have relations where the
        classes are related either through aggregation or inheritance.</li>
      <li>All All Relations - Adds classes that have standard relations plus
        relations where member functions are related to the other classes.</li>
      <li>Zoom - Zooms the diagram.<br>
      </li>
      <li>Removing class - Removes the selected class</li>
      <li>Remove All Classes - Removes all classes</li>
      <li>Restart - Adds the classes with standard relations<br>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h3><a class="mozTocH2 mozTocH3" name="mozTocId381773"></a>Class Diagram
      Symbols</h3>
    So what are circles and V shapes doing on the drawings? Don't worry, they
    can be turned off if desired. These extra Oov symbols are used to provide
    quick visibility into other relations that are not displayed on standard UML
    diagrams. The goal is to find and show as many relationships as possible on
    the diagram for quick understandability and verification of the code.
    <p> (See the screenshots to see examples.) The enhanced symbols are: </p>
    <ul>
      <li>the nested circles indicate the private, public, protected scope
        relations. Fully empty means public, and fully filled means private,
        otherwise it is protected.</li>
      <li>the V shape indicates read only (const)</li>
      <li>the circle standing alone means a relationship with a function
        variable</li>
      <li>a small circle next to a circle is a function parameter relationship.</li>
    </ul>
    The other symbols are standard UML symbols.
    <h3><a class="mozTocH3" name="mozTocId213642"></a>Class Diagram Display

      <li>Select the Analysis/Settings menu item.</li>
      <li>Choose the "Draw Options" tab and check or uncheck the various
        options. These options do not change how classes are added to the
        diagrams.</li>
    </ol>
    <h2><a class="mozTocH3 mozTocH2" name="mozTocId261032"></a>Portion Diagrams</h2>
    <p>Portion diagrams show the data members of a class, and show the
      operations that are related to each data member.&nbsp; These diagrams make
      it easy to visualize a class's composition to allow for refactoring or for
      understandability.</p>

    <h2><a class="mozTocH3 mozTocH2" name="mozTocId261032"></a>Sequence Diagrams</h2>
    Sequence or operation diagrams are similar to UML (Unified Modelling
    Language) sequence diagrams. They display the member functions of the
    classes, and some detail of the members and relations to members in other
    classes.<br>
    <br>
    Sequence diagrams are only slightly modified from standard UML diagrams. The
    guard conditions are not shown on each arrow, but are instead shown on the
    lifeline blocks. This prevents duplication of the condition for each
    operation call, and is still very easy to read for someone that is used to
    UML. <br>
    <ol>
      <li>Selecting a class in the class list will change the operations in the
        Operations (Oper tab) list. Clicking on an operation will display the
        sequence diagram for the operation.</li>
      <li>Selecting an operation from the operation list will display the
        contents of the operation.</li>
      <li>Right clicking on the sequence diagram depends on whether a class or
        operation is clicked on. Right clicking allows:</li>
      <ol>
        <li>Go To Operation - Displays a new diagram for the different
          operation.</li>
        <li>Add Calls - Expands the selected call to show the child calls</li>
        <li>Add Callers - Shows the operations that call the selected operation.<br>

    <ol>
      <li>Use File/Save or File/Save As to save an SVG file. A class diagram
        will be saved if the class diagram is displayed, otherwise the sequence
        diagram will be saved.</li>
      <li>Download Inkscape from <a href="http://inkscape.org/">inkscape.org</a></li>

    <h2><a class="mozTocH1 mozTocH2" name="mozTocId108517"></a>Complexity
      Analysis</h2>
    <p>Code complexity is a measure of complexity for each function.&nbsp; The
      purpose of the measure is to help to determine the amount of testing
      required for various functions.&nbsp; Higher numbers indicate that more
      testing must be performed.</p>

    <h1><a class="mozTocH3 mozTocH1" name="mozTocId246966"></a>Build System</h1>
    The build system is not required to view diagrams.<br>
    <br>
    There must be a set of installed build tools such as clang or GNU. The
    oovBuilder manages the project source, and is an executable that can be run
    from the command line. It can be run from the build menu in the oovcde
    program. <br>
    <br>
    <h2><a class="mozTocH3 mozTocH2" name="mozTocId102170"></a>Build Features</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Provides a very simple setup for building projects</li>
      <li>Eliminates reasons for "clean". Rarely any out of date dependencies</li>
      <li>Source directories are not cluttered up with build files.</li>
      <li>Fast builds using multitasking. Multitasking is used to analyze and
        build multiple object, library, executables files</li>
      <li>Component names are derived from the directory names of directories
        that contain C++ source files.</li>
      <li>Directories are scanned to find header files, and generate include
        paths.</li>
      <li>Directories are scanned to find libraries, and library symbols are
        parsed to determine library link order, and to determine which static
        libraries are required for executables and shared libraries. </li>
      <li>Source files are parsed using CLang to find include dependencies.
        Include dependencies are used to determine which files need to be built.
        Rebuilding will only compile files that need to be rebuilt based on
        dependencies.</li>
      <li>External packages can be specified by selecting the package, or the
        root path of external projects can be specified for locations of header
        and library files. On Linux, the pkg-config system is used to find
        available packages. Exclusion criteria can be used to select only one of
        many types of library or header files.</li>
      <li>Build tools are determined from paths and installed tools, but can be
        specified manually.</li>
      <li>Project information is scanned and stored for different sets of build
        arguments. Debug and release configurations will not conflict.</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <h2><a class="mozTocH3 mozTocH2" name="mozTocId675000"></a>Build Quick Start</h2>
    The examples are a quick way to understand some basic principles. See
	<a href="examples.html">Examples</a>.<br>
    The build user guide is at <a href="oovcdebuildhelp.html">Oovcde
 Build Help</a>
    <br/>
    The build details are described in
	<a href="http://oovcde.sourceforge.net/design/OovcdeBuildDesign.html">Oovcde
 Build Design</a>.<br>
    Note that the Oovcde binary packages do not include a compiler for building.<br>
    <br>
    The following steps can be followed:<br>
    <br>
    <ul>
      <li>Run Oovcde and either create a new project, or open an existing
        project. Either the gnu or clang compilers should be installed in the
        system. In Windows, Oovcde searches the path and if LLVM is present,
        then clang++ is used as the compiler. In Linux, the clang++ compiler is
        searched for in the /usr/bin directory, and if found clang++ is used as
        the compiler.</li>
      <li>Add some references to external project packages. These are specified
        under Analysis/Settings/Build Arguments.</li>
      <ul>
        <li>Use the External Project Packages button to specify a package on the
          system. In Linux, this uses pkg-confg, and will define all includes,
          flags and libraries. In Windows, there are a few predefined packages
          that are defined in a file in the bin directory. </li>
        <li>If the required external packages do not exist, either custom
          packages can be created, or add some external project root references.
        </li>
        <li>An external directory can be specified, and may look like
          "-ERC:\ExternalPackage". The full syntax allows excluding some
          subdirectories using an exclamation point as a not symbol. This is
          required for cases where external project references contain multiple
          libraries with the same symbols. For example,
          "-ER/home/dave/software/oovcde/2.0/clang+llvm-3.2!libclang_rt" will
          prevent using any path with libclang_rt in it.</li>
      </ul>
      <li>Select Build/Settings and specify what type of output to produce for
        each component listed in the dialog. If the needed components are not
        listed, then Oovcde will not build your type of project. Either
        rearrange the directory structure, or contact the Oovcde developers.<br>
      </li>
      <li>Run Build/Build Debug or Build/Build Release.<br>
      </li>
    </ul>
    The trunk/test/trunk-oovcde directorys show example files for building the
    oovcde project. This is a somewhat complex project since it uses both Gtk
    and Clang, and has multiple libraries and executables. Early versions of
    CLang on Windows required building CLang, and the complex library order for
    Clang was able to be determined by the build system.<br>
    <br>
    <h2><a class="mozTocH4 mozTocH2" name="mozTocId349590"></a>Cross Compiling</h2>
    The following example shows the use of Ubuntu for cross compiling to an ARM
    hard float platform. This requires that the gcc-arm-linux-gnueabihf package
    is installed using apt-get or synaptic:<br>
    <ul>
      <li>Select Analysis/Settings</li>
      <li>Select Debug under Build Configurations, and click the NewConfig
        button. Enter "Arm-Debug" as a new configuration.<br>
      </li>
      <li>Enter arm-linux-gnueabihf-g++ for the Compiler Path</li>
      <li>Add to the Common Build Arguments:</li>
      <ul>
        <li>-fPIC</li>
        <li>-march=armv7-a</li>
        <li>-mfloat-abi=hard</li>
      </ul>
      <li>Add something like the fillowing to the Extra Build Arguments for the
        Arm-Debug configuration:</li>
      <ul>
        <li>-lnk-L/target-sysroot/arm-linux-gnueabihf/usr/lib</li>
        <li>-lnk-L/target-sysroot/arm-linux-gnueabihf/lib</li>
        <li>-lnk-Wl,-rpath-link,/target-sysroot/arm-linux-gnueabihf/usr/lib</li>
        <li>-lnk-Wl,-rpath-link,/target-sysroot/arm-linux-gnueabihf/lib</li>
      </ul>
      <li>When compiling, the linker may say, "cannot find", and then list some
        library name. If the target files were copied from the device, the links
        may contain paths to the directories for the target machine. This files
        can be edited and the paths removed so that the local files are found.If
        shared libraries are created, there may be some cases where a static
        library can be hidden by being renamed to force the shared library to be
        used. </li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <h2><a class="mozTocH4 mozTocH2" name="mozTocId206848"></a>Resolving Include
      Problems During Analysis</h2>
    The Oovcde analysis will often produce usable output even when include files
    cannot be found, although this may result in missing classes, or methods in
    sequence diagrams.<br>
    <br>
    Oovcde uses the OovCppParser to perform the analysis, and the OovCppParser
    uses CLang. Clang has hard coded paths compiled into the analysis binary.
    Compilers will only search for a certain set of include paths. See the
    include problems below for more information.
    <p> Oovcde produces analysis directories for each set of build
      arguments.&nbsp; This is in case the classes may be different for debug or
      release, etc. </p>
    <p> The analysis directories are not kept unique for the clang and GCC
      compilers. Build argument differences are used to make unique analysis
      directories. If they are using the same directory, and different include
      paths are needed, set an argument that is different so that different
      analysis directories are used.<br>
    </p>
    <h3><a class="mozTocH5 mozTocH3" name="mozTocId824690"></a>Windows Include
      Problems</h3>
    Things can be difficult especially on Windows since Oovcde by default uses
    CLang for analysis, and can use either CLang or the gnu compiler for builds.
    The gnu compiler is available from the MinGW, MinGW-builds or MinGW-W64
    projects. The old MinGW-builds project has now been incorporated into
    MinGW-W64. MinGW-builds or MinGW-W64 is required to build Oovcde instead of
    mingw because it supports C++11 threading.
    <p> The gnu compiler will normally find include and library paths since the
      compiler searches paths relative to the g++ directory. The CLang compiler
      will find many mingw paths, but does not find paths for Mingw-W64. </p>
    <p> Switching between the packages often requires nothing more than changing
      the path environment variable or setting the compiler name in the Oovcde
      Analysis/Settings/Build Arguments dialog.<br>
    </p>
    <p> CLang normally finds mingw by searching for default paths, but does not
      find mingw-w64. For this reason, mingw-w64 is defined as a package that
      can be included in the Analysis/Settings/ menu in the Build Arguments tab
      using the External Project Packages button. </p>
    <p> So there are a few usage scenarios:<br>
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Perform Analysis with Oovcde using Mingw - Typically CLang will
        require include files to be in \MinGW </li>
      <li>Perform Analysis with Oovcde using Mingw-W64 or Build Oovcde - Use
        MinGW-W64 by selecting the package in the project and ensuring the path
        is correct </li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    If the compiler cannot find a standard library file, then it isn't finding
    the file in its include directories. To view the CLang or GCC compiler
    include paths, use the -v option in the Oovcde Analysis/Settings/Build
    Arguments.
    <p> The typical location for mingw is in the \MinGW directory. CLang
      supports the following MinGW installations on Windows.<br>
      <br>

    <h2><a class="mozTocH4 mozTocH2" name="mozTocId813985"></a>Build Sequence</h2>
    The detailed sequence of the build is:
    <ul>
      <li>The user specifies the source root directory and output oovcde project
        directory. The build system scans the source root directory for include
        and source files. Each directory with source files is considered a
        component. Each directory with include files is added to the initial
        include paths.</li>
      <li>The program tries to determine the compiler and other build tools.
        <ul>
          <li>On Windows, the path is searched for clang, otherwise the build
            tools default to the GNU tools. (g++, ar, etc.) The llvm-ar tool is
            not used on Windows since it does not work.</li>
          <li>On Linux, the path is checked for /usr/bin/clang++, and if not
            present, the build tools default to the GNU tools. </li>
          <li>Manually edit oovcde.txt to change build tools.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>The user specifies additional external project packages or package
        roots for includes and libraries. If include files are found, the paths
        are added to the initial include paths. If libraries are found, the
        paths are added to the initial library paths. The user must specify the
        project packages in the correct order. Include paths are scanned in the
        order that packages and external references are specified. During the
        link, the libraries are scanned in opposite order. Project package order
        is determined by the builder.</li>
      <li>The program parses the source files for include dependencies using the
        initial include paths. The include dependencies are optimized so only
        needed include paths are used to detect dependencies for each component.</li>
      <li>The program generates a list of components that could be built.</li>
      <li>The user specifies the type of component such as static library,
        shared library or program.</li>
      <li>The user can start a build.</li>
      <li>The dependencies of external project libraries are determined to
        create libraries in the correct order for the linker. The external
        project libraries are used in the opposite order that the external
        project roots were specified. The library dependencies are optimizes so
        only needed libraries are used for each component. </li>
      <li>Only out of date targets are built.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2><a class="mozTocH4 mozTocH2" name="mozTocId932506"></a>Project
      Limitations</h2>
    There are some limitations on projects. The basic rule is that a directory
    can be defined as a component and all source files that are contained in
    that directory or other child directories of that directory will be used to
    build the component. The include files can be in any child directory, and
    will be found automatically.<br>
    <br>
    If multiple directories are used to build a component that are not under one
    directory, it is possible to create many static libraries. Oovcde will
    determine static library link order automatically.<br>
    <br>
    The following shows a typical project that can be supported. <br>
    <br>
    Root directory of project source code<br>
    <pre>  Sub-directory1 - Component1<br>      *.cpp - All of these files are used for Component1<br>      *.h - These can be used by any component<br><br>  Sub-directory2<br>      *.h - These can be used by any component<br><br>  Sub-directory3<br>      Sub-directory4 - Component2<br>          *.cpp - These can only be used for Component2<br>          *.h - These can be used by any component<br><br>  Sub-directory5 - Component3<br>      Sub-directory6<br>          *.cpp - These can be used for Component3<br><br>  Sub-directory7<br>          *.cpp - These can be used for Component3</pre>
    <br>
    There are also these limitations.<br>
    <ul>
      <li>Only GNU or clang projects. CLang support for MSVC projects is
        improving, but unknown.<br>
      </li>
      <li>External project roots are expected that they will not be changed. In
        order to update library information, delete the out/sym files.</li>
      <li>The component names will be created from the directory names.</li>
      <li>Some duplicate filenames (includes) may cause problems for determining
        dependencies. Circular dependencies may cause problems. These may be
        able to be resolved:
        <ul>
          <li>View oovcde-incdep.txt to see include directory dependencies found
            by compiler</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Only C++ is compiled. (No .C or .ASM) Other types of files must be put
        into external objects or libraries.</li>
    </ul>
    There are some problems using llvm/clang 3.2 on Windows or Linux. The build
    tool will attempt to use tools that are known to work. CLang 3.4 may not
    have these problems.<br>
    <ul>
      <li>Symbols are not exported. This appears to be a compile time (clang++)
        problem.</li>
      <li>The llvm-ar tool will cause a link error</li>
      <li>The llvm-nm tool has no output on Linux, and gives a bad file error on
        Windows.</li>
